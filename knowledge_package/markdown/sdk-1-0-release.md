===============

17 Jul 2026 - Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri Malaysia

Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri Malaysia has provisioned SDK 1.0 Release to help taxpayers in preparing for the upcoming MyInvois System. SDK Updates section below highlights key updates as part of this release.

SDK Updates
===========

**17 July 2026**

**Updates to Documentation for Tax Exemption**

• The SDK documentation has been updated to clarify the treatment of tax amounts for tax-exempt transactions. The element **cbc:TaxAmount is not required to be 0.00.** Taxpayers may report the actual tax amount that would have been payable prior to the exemption. The presence of cbc:TaxExemptionReason does not imply that cbc:TaxAmount must be zero. No validation rules have been changed, and existing intergrations remain unaffected.

**08 July 2026**

**Introduction to New Document Versions for e-Invoice Special Voluntary Disclosure Programme (SVDP)**

• **e-Invoice Special Voluntary Disclosure Programme (SVDP) has been introduced** as an ongoing effort to support taxpayers in regularising their e-Invoice compliance, effective period until 31 December 2027.

• To support the implementation of the programme, **HASiL has introduced new document versions** in the MyInvois Software Development Kit (SDK).

o SVDP 1.2 – without digital signature   
o SVDP 1.3 – with digital signature

Taxpayers and service providers are advised to update their systems in accordance with the **latest SDK specifications and refer to the e-Invoice Guideline and Specific Guidelines** for the applicable requirements and procedures under e-Invoice SVDP.

• Taxpayers and service providers are advised to ensure the following:

  a. **Update your integration** to support the new document versions (SVDP 1.2 and SVDP 1.3)

  b. The document version SVDP 1.2 and SVDP 1.3 can only be **used during the effective period** of the e-Invoice SVDP.

  c. For Batch Upload users, please **download and use the latest version of the Batch Upload** template that supports the document version SVDP 1.2 and SVDP 1.3 before submitting e-Invoices.

  d. All existing document validation rules remain applicable unless otherwise specified in the SDK.

Please refer to the sample below for reference:

[Invoice SVDP 1.2 (without digital signature) Sample XML](/files/sdksamples/1.2-Invoice-Sample.xml)  
[Invoice SVDP 1.2 (without digital signature) Sample JSON](/files/sdksamples/1.2-Invoice-Sample.json)  
[Invoice SVDP 1.3 (with digital signature) Sample XML](/files/sdksamples/1.3-Invoice-Sample.xml)  
[Invoice SVDP 1.3 (with digital signature) Sample JSON](/files/sdksamples/1.3-Invoice-Sample.json)

Please ensure your system is updated to support SVDP 1.2 or SVDP 1.3 to facilitate participation in the e-Invoice SVDP, enabling taxpayers to rectify inaccuracies and regularise compliance with HASiL’s e-Invoice requirements.
