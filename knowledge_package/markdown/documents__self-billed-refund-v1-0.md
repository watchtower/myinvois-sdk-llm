Overview
========

Self-billed Refund Note is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

Note for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.0">14</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```
