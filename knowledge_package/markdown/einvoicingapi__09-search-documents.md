Search Documents
================

This API allows taxpayer's systems to search the documents sent or received which are available on the MyInvois System using various filters.

[Get Document Details](/einvoicingapi/08-get-document-details/)
[Search Taxpayer's TIN](/einvoicingapi/10-search-taxpayer-tin/)

Overview
--------

The Search Documents API has various enhanced filters for precise queries and provides access to large result set in a paginated way.

Search documents allows users to query the system and return list of documents that have been received or issued.

To invoke this API, users must provide values for either the `submissionDateFrom` and `submissionDateTo` filter parameters or the `issueDateFrom` and `issueDateTo` filter parameters. Users can combine these optional filters in various ways to obtain precise results.

Results will be returned in a paginated format based on the specified `pageSize`, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of results.

**Note**: The values of the input filter parameters should remain consistent when requesting subsequent pages of results.

Days difference between `submissionDateFrom` and `submissionDateTo` filter parameters, and `issueDateFrom` and `issueDateTo` filter parameters should not exceed a configured number of days set by e-Invoice system administrators (Current configuration is 31 days).

Results list is ordered based on registration date of the submission descending (newest documents submitted into the e-Invoice system appear first).

Signature
---------

This is REST based that accepts the below URL filter parameters to search for documents.

Signature:
`GET /api/v1.0/documents/search?&uuid={uuid}&submissionDateFrom={submissionDateFrom}&submissionDateTo={submissionDateTo}&pageSize={pageSize}&pageNo={pageNo}&issueDateFrom={issueDateFrom}&issueDateTo={issueDateTo}&invoiceDirection={invoiceDirection}&status={status}&documentType={documentType}&searchQuery={searchQuery}`

Rate Limit
----------

To optimize the use of our APIs, a rate limit of 12 Requests Per Minute (RPM) / Client ID is recommended.

### Throttling and Rate limiting

To allow consistent performance for all taxpayers using e-Invoice API and prevent overuse of resources, this API has throttling limits set per taxpayer (current configuration is **1 Request every 5 Seconds**). The throttling limit is subject to change by e-Invoice system administrators.

See the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/) for more details when your calls to the API are throttled.

### Error Response

Error situations are reported back by this API through the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/).

Additional considerations
-------------------------

Days difference between `submissionDateFrom` and `submissionDateTo` filter parameters, and `issueDateFrom` and `issueDateTo` filter parameters are currently configured to 31 days. Days difference value can be changed by e-Invoice system administrators.

There are maximum number of 10,000 documents that can be returned by this endpoint. You can use the various optional filters to get the desired documents results.

Receiver of the documents can retrieve documents that are in statuses `Valid` or `Cancelled`. If document exists, and is issued to given receiver, but status is `Submitted` or `Invalid`, document will not be part of the response. Issuer of the documents can retrieve documents in any status. The document validation or public URL can be created using below -

```
{envbaseurl}/uuid-of-document/share/longid
```

where {envbaseurl} need to be replaced with MyInvois portal Base URL

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• Search document API is designed for your manual auditing requirements and also for troubleshooting issues. This API shouldn't be used for ERP system reconciliation implementation with the MyInvois system. Excessive requests for this API may result in throttling. System may impose limits on the usage policy of this API. These limits will be based on each client ID and hence would be linked to the specific ERP system using the APIs.

• Optimise search queries by applying specific filters and parameters to narrow down the results, improving the efficiency of your searches. Avoid making repetitive searches with identical criteria, and where applicable, cache the results to reduce redundant API calls.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.
