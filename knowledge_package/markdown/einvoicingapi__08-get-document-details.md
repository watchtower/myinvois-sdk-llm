### Error Response

Error situations are reported back by this API through the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/).

Additional considerations
-------------------------

To get the unique ID that will be used to call this API, taxpayer system can first call API returning list of [recent documents](/einvoicingapi/05-get-recent-documents/).

Receiver of the documents can retrieve documents that are in “Valid” or “Cancelled” status. If document exists, and is issued to given receiver, but status is “submitted” or “invalid”, not found code will be returned.

Issuer of the documents can retrieve documents in any status. The document validation or public URL can be created using below -

```
{envbaseurl}/uuid-of-document/share/longid
```

where {envbaseurl} need to be replaced with MyInvois portal Base URL

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• Use the Get Document Details API only to retrieve error details or exceptions in invalid documents. For checking submission status , utilise the 'Get Submission API' with a polling frequency of 3-5 seconds. Excessive requests for the same document may result in throttling. The system may impose usage limits on this API. Which will be based on each client ID and will therefore be linked to the specific ERP system utilising the APIs.

• Kindly note that the ‘Get Document Details’ API should be used exclusively for retrieving error information or exceptions related to invalid documents. For status updates, please use the ‘Get Submission’ API and adhere to a polling frequency of 3-5 seconds to avoid system throttling.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.
