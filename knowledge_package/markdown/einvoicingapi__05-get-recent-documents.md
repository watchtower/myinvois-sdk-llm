Overview
--------

Get recent documents API allows users to query the system and return list of documents that have been recently received or issued .

System limits the number of the documents that can be received in one request by implementing paging mechanism for this API and also by not allowing to request documents that are issued more than 31 days ago.

List is ordered based on registration date of the submission descending.

### Error Response

Error situations are reported back by this API through the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/).

Additional considerations
-------------------------

This API is limited to retrieve only certain maximum number of documents and to query only certain “time window” of the documents to prevent huge queries to be executed. These maximum parameters are defined by e-Invoice system administrators.

Time window is a configurable parameter configured by Tax Authuority. Current configuration is **31 days**.

The maximum number of documents that can be returned by this endpoint is **10,000 documents**. You can use the various optional filters to get the desired documents results.

Receiver of the documents can retrieve documents that are in statuses `Valid` or `Cancelled`. If document exists, and is issued to given receiver, but status is `Submitted` or `Invalid`, document will not be part of the response. Issuer of the documents can retrieve documents in any status. The document validation or public URL can be created using below -

```
{envbaseurl}/uuid-of-document/share/longid
```

where {envbaseurl} need to be replaced with e-Invoice portal Base URL

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• The 'Get Recent Document' API should be used for troubleshooting issues and it was not designed for reconciliation between your ERP system and the MyInvois system. Excessive use of this API may result in throttling. The system may impose limits on the usage policy of this API. Which will be based on each client ID and will be linked to the specific ERP system using the APIs.

• Kindly note that the ‘Get Recent Documents’ API is intended to assist with troubleshooting issues, rather than for reconciliation between your ERP system and the MyInvois system. Excessive use of this API for purposes other than troubleshooting may result in system throttling.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.
