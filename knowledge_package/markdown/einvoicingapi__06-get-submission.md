### Error Response

Error situations are reported back by this API through the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/).

Additional considerations

Maximum page size allowed is defined by e-Invoice system administrators.

This API is available to issuers that are querying their submissions. This also includes authorized intermediaries (service providers) who submitted the documents on behalf of the taxpayer they represent.

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• Use the ‘Get Submission API’ to monitor the status of submissions and documents. Ensure a 3-5 second interval between requests to avoid system throttling, which may occur if too many requests are made for the same submission. These limits are based on each client ID and will be linked to the specific ERP system using the APIs.

• To prevent system overload and ensure optimal functionality, it is recommend to adjust the ‘Get Submission’ API calls to a polling interval of 3-5 seconds, with a maximum rate of 300 request per minute (RPM).

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.
