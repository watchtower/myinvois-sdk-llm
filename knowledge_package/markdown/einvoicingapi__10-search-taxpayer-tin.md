Notes
-----

**Important !**

• This API should be used to Search for TIN before this is used to submit the documents. This should be cached from the ERP system side so that to reduce the calls occurring on this API. Excessive requests for this API may result in throttling and would be treated as malicious activity in this case. System may impose limits on the usage policy of this API. These limits will be based on each client ID and hence would be linked to the specific ERP system using the APIs.

• API would return one and only one search result and if more than one result can be found matching the search criteria then the API would return an error as described above to the caller.

• It is advised to perform validation of buyer's TINs when the buyer entity is being defined in your ERP system and once validated reflect this in your ERP system to make sure there is no need to recall the same API repeatedly.

• It is not advised to call this API before every document submission as in this case this may result in these calls being flagged and throttled as well.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.
