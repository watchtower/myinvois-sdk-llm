Get Document
============

This API allows taxpayers to retrieve document source in XML or JSON format along with the additional tax authority metadata.

[Get Submission](/einvoicingapi/06-get-submission/)
[Get Document Details](/einvoicingapi/08-get-document-details/)

Overview
--------

This API allows caller to get full details of the document when requested by unique ID assigned to document by MyInvois System.

Details include original XML or JSON submission and additional tax authority metadata i.e., additional ID, and current status. As the document is submitted in XML or JSON, this API returns document information also in either XML or JSON.

Document with invalid status will not be returned. Details of the invalid document can be fetched by [Get Document Details](/einvoicingapi/08-get-document-details/) API.

Signature
---------

This is REST based API that takes unique ID of the document as URL parameter and returns document details that were received from the issuer and additional details added after submission and validation of the document by the tax authority.

Signature:
`GET /api/v1.0/documents/{uuid}/raw`

### Error Response

Error situations are reported back by this API through the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/).

Additional considerations
-------------------------

To get the unique ID that will be used to call this API, taxpayer system can first call API returning list of [recent documents](/einvoicingapi/05-get-recent-documents/).

Receiver of the documents can retrieve documents that are in “Valid” or “Cancelled” status. If document exists, and is issued to given receiver, but status is “submitted” or “invalid”, not found code will be returned.

Issuer of the documents can retrieve documents in any status. The document validation or public URL can be created using below -

```
{envbaseurl}/uuid-of-document/share/longid
```

where {envbaseurl} need to be replaced with MyInvois portal Base URL

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• Repeated invocation of this API to retrieve document details can lead to unnecessary system load and inefficiency. Instead, maintain a local copy of the documents. This ensures documents can be accessed when needed without frequent API calls, thereby improving system performance and reducing overhead.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.
