Validator supports validating both [XML](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1.html) and [JSON](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1-JSON/v2.0/cnd01/UBL-2.1-JSON-v2.0-cnd01.html) based documents. We support [UBL 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1.html) standards for Invoice documents.

Referenced Documents Validator
------------------------------

Validator that is used to perform validation of submitted credit notes, debit notes and refund notes to make sure that the documents being referenced to are valid invoices at the moment of issuance of a new credit note, debit note and refund note.
