Overview
--------

The main function of the MyInvois System is to enable submission of the issued documents to tax authority. There are multiple types of documents supported by the solution and this API allows taxpayer ERP systems to retrieve their definitions through API call.

Signature
---------

This is REST based API that does not take additional URL parameters, yet it returns the list of active and deactivated document types that were once active.

Signature:
`GET /api/v1.0/documenttypes`

Inputs
------

This API accepts [standard e-Invoice API header parameters](/standard-header-parameters/) for authenticated call.

No additional URL or request body parameters are provided to this API.

Outputs
-------

Get Document Type Version
=========================

This API allows taxpayer's ERP system to retrieve the details of document type version that contains structure definitions of the documents.

[Get Document Type](/api/04-get-document-type/)
[Get Notifications](/api/06-get-notifications/)

Overview
--------

This API allows taxpayer ERP system to retrieve the details of document type version that contains structure definitions of the documents that are expected to be submitted as part of [document submission](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/).

Document type versions are used to allow document type data fields to be evolved over time without introducing a new document type. For example, if the document type version 1.0 include optional field(s), such field(s) could at a later time be made mandatory in document type version 2.0

Note that it is possible for one document type to have multiple valid document type versions to ease transition. In other words, taxpayers would still be able to submit old versions for validation despite the new / updated version has been deployed. It is however suggested for the taxpayers to migrate to the latest document type version as soon as possible.

Signature
---------

This is REST based API that takes unique ID of the document type and ID of the document type as URL parameter and returns full document type version object.

Signature:
`GET /api/v1.0/documenttypes/{id}/versions/{vid}`

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | Number | Unique ID of existing document type | 45 | Mandatory |
| vid | Number | Unique ID of existing document type version that is published or deactivated | 41235 | Mandatory |

Outputs
-------

### Successful Response

This API returns HTTP status code `200`.

The resulting structure is a single object of type `DocumentTypeVersion`.

Document Type Version contains:

| Output parameter | Type | Description | Value example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| name | String | Name of the document type version within the document type that can be used in document submission to identify document type version being submitted | 1.0 |
| description | String | Description of the document type version | Credit note version 1.0 |
| versionNumber | Decimal | Unique version number of the document type version that can be sorted to find the latest version | 1.0 |
| status | String | Status of the document type version - “published”, “deactivated” | published |
| activeFrom | Date | Date when the activity of the document type version started | 2015-02-13T13:15:00Z |
| activeTo | Date | Optional: date when the activity of the document type version sends/when it was deactivated | 2027-03-01T00:00:00Z |

### Error Response

Error situations are reported back by this API through the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/).

Overview
--------

MyInvois System supports (i) sending out notification via email and (ii) storing the notification in notification history. The ERP system are able to utilise the Get Notification API to query the notification history to obtain the notifications. Note that reliance on notifications for implementing entire e-Invoice workflow is optional and it is provided as an additional functionality that can be leveraged.

Login as Taxpayer System
========================

This API is used to authenticate the ERP system associated with a specific taxpayer calling and issue access token which allows ERP system to access those protected APIs.

[Full Platform API list](/api/)
[Login as Intermediary System](/api/08-login-as-intermediary-system/)

Overview
--------

MyInvois APIs are protected except the Login APIs (Login as taxpayer and Login as Intermediary System) and made available only to relevant taxpayer’s representatives and their ERP systems.

This API is used to authenticate the ERP system calling and issue access token which allows ERP system to access those protected APIs. Note that each token issued is issued for a certain time period configured as part of MyInvois System, example can be found in [expires\_in](#successful-response). This means that compliant ERP systems integrating with the solution should expect that some calls will return unauthorised error codes (see more on [standard error responses](/standard-error-response/)) which means that most likely the token issued has expired and needs to be renewed (by another login).

**Note!** Authentication of the systems is done on identity service, not on the service hosting actual integration APIs. Use the Identity Service base address when creating the full URL to be called.

Signature
---------

As described in the [Getting started overview](/start/), solution is leveraging externalised standards based identity system to manage users, systems that are accessing solution user interfaces and APIs.

Therefore solution leverages [OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) for authenticating systems and granting them access token that allows them to call other APIs described in this SDK which requires authorisation.

Signature:
`POST /connect/token`

Rate Limit
----------

To optimize the use of our APIs, a rate limit of 12 Requests Per Minute (RPM) / Client ID is recommended.

Inputs
------

| Body parameter | Type | Description | Value example | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| client\_id | String | Client ID for the ERP system. |  | Mandatory |
| client\_secret | String | Client secret for the ERP system. |  | Mandatory |
| grant\_type | String | Must be ‘client\_credentials’ | client\_credentials | Mandatory |
| scope | String | Optional parameter asking for a specific access scope. In case of external access to e-Invoice APIs, this parameter can be omitted | InvoicingAPI | Optional |

Outputs
-------

### Successful Response

This API returns HTTP status code `200`.

| Output parameter | Type | Description | Value example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| access\_token | JWT token | Encoded JWT token structure that contains the fields of the issued token, token protection attributes | Encoded token value |
| token\_type | String | Solution in this case returns only Bearer authentication tokens | Bearer |
| expires\_in | Number | The lifetime of the access token defined in seconds | 3600 (means it is valid for one hour) |
| scope | String | Optional if matches the requested scope. Otherwise contains information on scope granted to token. This defines the APIs that client will have access to use this token. | InvoicingAPI |

### Error Responses: 400 Bad Request

| Output parameter | Type | Description | Value example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| error | String | Possible values: invalid\_request, invalid\_client, invalid\_grant, unauthorised\_client, unsupported\_grant\_type, invalid\_scope | invalid\_request |
| error\_description | String | Optional human readable error message containing more details about error encountered. | User blocked |
| error\_uri | URI | Optional URI containing more information about the error. Not used in MyInvois System |  |

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Each token already includes information about the taxpayer that the system is going to represent, therefore taxpayer information is available to the solution APIs when API calls are being done at a later point.

System authentication can be rejected if (i) invalid client ID and secret is used to authenticate; or (ii) the system user registered against the taxpayer is blocked or expired.

Tokens issued as a result of the login operation are valid only for a pre-configured limited time. It is configured to be 1 hour.

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• The system token is valid for 60 minutes. Use this token for API operations rather than generating a new one for each request. If tokens are requested for every operation, the system may impose limits on token requests. These limits will be based on each client ID and hence would be linked to the specific ERP system using the APIs.

• To optimise performance, avoid making frequent login attempts. Instead, use session tokens to maintain active sessions. In the event of failed login attempts, implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to prevent overloading the system. Always ensure that credentials are securely stored, and use HTTPS for all API calls to safeguard sensitive data.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.

Signature:
`POST /connect/token`

Rate Limit
----------

To optimize the use of our APIs, a rate limit of 12 Requests Per Minute (RPM) / Client ID is recommended.

Inputs
------

When trying to login as intermediary, add an extra header parameter to the request. This header parameter will be mapped to the taxpayer that the intermediary is trying to login on his behalf.

**Note!** When trying to login as intermediary, permissions that are granted by the taxpayer will be applied on the intermediary's profile and this will control the functionalities that they will be able to executed on behalf of the taxpayer they are representing.

| Header parameter | Type | Description | Value example | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| onbehalfof | String | This should be either the Tax Identification Number (TIN) of the taxpayer the intermediary is representing, or it can follow the format : if the intermediary is representing a taxpayer identified by an ROB number. | C25845632020 (in case of taxpayer identified by TIN only), or IG12345678912:201901234567 (in case of taxpayer identified by TIN and has an ROB number) | Mandatory |

| Body parameter | Type | Description | Value example | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| client\_id | String | Client ID for the ERP system. |  | Mandatory |
| client\_secret | String | Client secret for the ERP system. |  | Mandatory |
| grant\_type | String | Must be “client\_credentials” | client\_credentials | Mandatory |
| scope | String | Optional parameter asking for a specific access scope. In case of external access to e-Invoice APIs, this parameter can be omitted | InvoicingAPI | Optional |

Outputs
-------

### Successful Response

This API returns HTTP status code `200`.

| Output parameter | Type | Description | Value example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| access\_token | JWT token | Encoded JWT token structure that contains the fields of the issued token, token protection attributes. | Encoded token value |
| token\_type | String | Solution in this case returns only Bearer authentication tokens | Bearer |
| expires\_in | Number | The lifetime of the access token defined in seconds | 3600 (means it is valid for one hour) |
| scope | String | Optional if matches the requested scope. Otherwise contains information on scope granted to token. This defines the APIs that client will have access to use this token. | InvoicingAPI |

### Error Responses: 400 Bad Request

| Output parameter | Type | Description | Value example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| error | String | Possible values: invalid\_request, invalid\_client, invalid\_grant, unauthorised\_client, unsupported\_grant\_type, invalid\_scope | invalid\_request |
| error\_description | String | Optional human readable error message containing more details about error encountered. | User blocked |
| error\_uri | URI | Optional URI containing more information about the error. Not used in MyInvois System |  |

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Each token already includes information about the taxpayer that the system is going to represent, therefore taxpayer information is available to the solution APIs when API calls are being done at a later point.

System authentication can be rejected if (i) invalid client ID and secret is used to authenticate; or (ii) the system user registered against the taxpayer is blocked or expired.

Tokens issued as a result of this login operation are valid only for a pre-configured limited time, example can be found in [expires\_in](#successful-response).

**Note:** Your system should be responsible to obtain a new access token using this endpoint before the expiry of the current valid token to continue calling the APIs.

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• It is advisable to use separate credentials for intermediary systems to avoid conflicts with taxpayer system credentials. To optimise performance, avoid making frequent login attempts. Instead, use session tokens to maintain active sessions. In the event of failed login attempts, implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to prevent overloading the system. Always ensure that credentials are securely stored, and use HTTPS for all API calls to safeguard sensitive data.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.

Document validation rules
=========================

Page describes the validation that is getting applied on every submitted document.

Document validation
===================

There are different kind of validations that get executed on the submitted document, below is the list of validators that run on submitted documents.

1. Structure Validator
2. Core Fields Validator
3. Signature Validator
4. Taxpayer Validator
5. Referenced Documents Validator
6. Code Validator
7. Duplicate Document Validator
8. Currency Validator

Structure Validator
-------------------

Validator that enables validation of the submitted document type version to check its structure matching what is required by the document type version. Validator supports validating both [XML](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1.html) and [JSON](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1-JSON/v2.0/cnd01/UBL-2.1-JSON-v2.0-cnd01.html) based documents. We support [UBL 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1.html) standards for Invoice documents.

Core Fields Validator
---------------------

Validator that is used to validate that the document contains at least the main fields that any document should have to be processed by the system

Signature Validator
-------------------

Validator that is responsible for validating the submitted document signature

Taxpayer Validator
------------------

Validator that is used to validate if the taxpayers referenced in the submitted document are valid at the date of issuance of the document. It also performs checks on the issuer that require asynchronous processing and cannot be done synchronously in core fields validator.

Referenced Documents Validator
------------------------------

Validator that is used to perform validation of submitted credit notes, debit notes and refund notes to make sure that the documents being referenced to are valid invoices at the moment of issuance of a new credit note, debit note and refund note.

Code Validator
--------------

Code validator is used to enable validation of various codes used in submitted documents to make sure it is referenced to valid codes, for example, currency codes and tax types. Refer to the [Code](/codes/) tables for more information.

Duplicate Document Validator
----------------------------

Validator that tries to find documents submitted recently that are similar / identical to the document that is being / has been processed to identify cases where the same document (often) by mistake has been submitted twice or even more than twice

Currency Validator
------------------

Validator is used to ensure correct usage of currency codes and exchange rates.

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Credit Note is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.0">02</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Data Structure
==============

Credit Note v1.1
================

v1.1 of the Credit Note document type structure is maintained as v1.0, the only difference is that signature validation is enabled on this version.

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Credit Note is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.1">02</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Debit Note is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.0">03</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Debit Note v1.1
===============

v1.1 of the debit Note document type structure is maintained as v1.0, the only difference is that signature validation is enabled on this version.

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Debit Note is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.1">03</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

v1.0 of the Invoice document type structure is maintained as v1.1, the only difference is that signature validation is disabled on this version. This version will be deprecated and replaced by version 1.1 at a later date that will be announced later.

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Invoice is the main document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.0">01</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Invoice v1.1
============

v1.1 of the Invoice document type structure is maintained as v1.0, the only difference is that signature validation is enabled on this version.

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Invoice is the main document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.1">01</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Refund Note v1.0
================

v1.0 of the Refund Note document type structure is maintained as v1.1, the only difference is that signature validation is disabled on this version. This version will be deprecated and replaced by version 1.1 at a later date that will be announced later.

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Refund Note is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.0">04</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Data Structure
==============

Core

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Refund Note is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.1">04</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Self-Billed Credit Note v1.0
============================

v1.0 of the Self-Billed Credit Note document type structure is maintained as v1.1, the only difference is that signature validation is disabled on this version. This version will be deprecated and replaced by version 1.1 at a later date that will be announced later.

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Self-billed Credit Note is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

Note for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.0">12</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Self-Billed Credit Note v1.1
============================

v1.1 of the Self-Billed Credit Note document type structure is maintained as v1.0, the only difference is that signature validation is enabled on this version.

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Self-billed Credit Note is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

Note for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.1">12</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Self-Billed Debit Note v1.0
===========================

v1.0 of the Self-Billed Debit Note document type structure is maintained as v1.1, the only difference is that signature validation is disabled on this version. This version will be deprecated and replaced by version 1.1 at a later date that will be announced later.

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Self-billed Debit Note is the main document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

Note for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.0">13</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Self-Billed Debit Note v1.1
===========================

v1.1 of the Self-Billed Debit Note document type structure is maintained as v1.0, the only difference is that signature validation is enabled on this version.

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Self-billed Debit Note is the main document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

Note for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.1">13</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Self-Billed Invoice v1.0
========================

v1.0 of the Self-Billed Invoice ddocument type structure is maintained as v1.1, the only difference is that signature validation is disabled on this version. This version will be deprecated and replaced by version 1.1 at a later date that will be announced later.

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Self-billed Invoice is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

Note for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.0">11</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Data Structure
==============

Self-Billed Invoice v1.1
========================

v1.1 of the Self-Billed Invoice document type is the initial version of the Invoices supported by the MyInvois System

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Self-billed Invoice is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

Note for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.1">11</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Self-Billed Refund Note v1.0
============================

v1.0 of the Self-Billed Refund Note document type structure is maintained as v1.1, the only difference is that signature validation is disabled on this version. This version will be deprecated and replaced by version 1.1 at a later date that will be announced later.

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Self-billed Refund Note is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

Note for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.0">14</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Self-Billed Refund Note v1.1
============================

v1.1 of the Self-Billed Refund Note document type structure is maintained as v1.0, the only difference is that signature validation is enabled on this version.

[Types](/types/)

Overview
========

Self-billed Refund Note is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.

Note for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.

### Guidance on constructing UBL -

In the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says

/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID

which means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.

For Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -

```
<Invoice>
    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID="1.1">14</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>
</Invoice>
```

Data Structure
==============

Core

The data structure of the self-billed refund note v1.0 document consists of a single `document` element that contains these additional elements. Note that this description defines the data structure while actual attribute naming could be different for JSON and XML data structures.

Validate Taxpayer's TIN
=======================

This API allows taxpayer's ERP system to validate specific Tax Identification Number (TIN) before adding this number to an invoice and issuing the invoice.

[Full e-Invoice API list](/einvoicingapi/)
[Submit Documents](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/)

Overview
--------

Validate Taxpayer’s TIN API is used to validate specific Tax Identification Number (TIN) before adding this number to an invoice and issuing the invoice.

**Note!** When you are logged in as intermediary, permissions that are granted by the taxpayer will be applied on your profile and this will control the functionalities that you'll be able to executed on behalf of the taxpayer you are representing.

Signature
---------

This is REST based API that validates TIN.

Signature:
`GET /api/v1.0/taxpayer/validate/{tin}?idType={idType}&idValue={idValue}`

Inputs
------

This API accepts [standard e-Invoice API header parameters](/standard-header-parameters/) for authenticated call except for the one defined below:

| Input parameter | Type | Description | Value example | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tin | Number | The Tax Identification Number to get the validity of the tin. | C25845632020 | Mandatory |
| idType | Query | NRIC, Passport number, Business registration number, army number | NRIC ID type example: NRIC  Passport ID type example: PASSPORT  BRN ID type example: BRN  Army ID type example: ARMY | Mandatory |
| idValue | Query | The actual value of the ID Type selected. For example, if NRIC selected as ID Type, then pass the NRIC value here. | BRN example: 201901234567 NRIC example: 770625015324 Passport number example: A12345678 Army number example: 551587706543 | Mandatory |

Outputs
-------

### Successful Response

This API returns HTTP status code `200`.

### Error Response

This API returns HTTP status code `400` (BadArgument) if the TIN or any of the input parameters does not match the argument structure.
  
This API returns HTTP status code `404` (Not Found) if that TIN and ID combination cannot be found or are considered invalid.

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• This API should be used to validate buyer's TIN before this is used to submit the documents. This should be cached from the ERP system side so that to reduce the calls occurring on this API. Excessive requests for this API may result in throttling and would be treated as malicious activity in this case. System may impose limits on the usage policy of this API. These limits will be based on each client ID and hence would be linked to the specific ERP system using the APIs.

• It is advised to perform validation of buyer's TINs when the buyer entity is being defined in your ERP system and once validated reflect this in your ERP system to make sure there is no need to recall the same API repeatedly.

• It is not advised to call this API before every document submission as in this case this may result in these calls being flagged and throttled as well.

• Always review the integration recommended practices here [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to make sure your ERP integration is implemented following them and following healthy integration patterns.

Submit Documents
================

This API allows taxpayer to submit one or more signed documents to MyInvois System.

[Validate taxpayer TIN](/einvoicingapi/01-validate-taxpayer-tin/)
[Cancel Document](/einvoicingapi/03-cancel-document/)

Overview
--------

Submit Documents API is the main API of the solution because it is used to submit one or more documents of different types to the system. Documents submitted are grouped into the submission. Then, each document that is part of the submission must be linked to and comply with data structure of the document type (see [document type versions supported](/types/)).

Document submission API supports documents submitted using JSON and XML format. Taxpayer ERP system or integration module is responsible for transforming the data into JSON or XML format as per the document type structure expected by API (see [document type versions supported](/types/)). Note that all documents within the submission and enclosing submission element itself needs to be in the same format. The format used should be provided through Content-type request header value.

When API is called, it performs minimal set of validations through [validation rules](/document-validation-rules/) to check that submission is of correct structure. Then, each document that is part of the submission is checked for the taxpayer issuing the documents. The structure of each document is checked that it matches the appropriate structure of the document type version used.

After synchronous validation succeeds, caller receives back the assigned submission ID and list of IDs of the documents that are accepted for further processing, matching them back to internal document IDs supplied so that callers can map them in taxpayer ERP system. These IDs can later be used to [retrieve documents](/einvoicingapi/07-get-document/), [submission information](/einvoicingapi/06-get-submission/) and learn about full validation results. If required, they can also be used to [cancel the document](/einvoicingapi/03-cancel-document/).

**Note!** When you are logged in as intermediary, permissions that are granted by the taxpayer will be applied on your profile and this will control the functionalities that you'll be able to executed on behalf of the taxpayer you are representing.

### Successful Response

On a successful submission, API returns unique submission ID and unique IDs for all documents accepted. These IDs assigned are mapped to the internal IDs that are inside the documents so that caller ERP system can map them back in the ERP as well.

Given that the process of validation is not complete when result is returned, API returns HTTP status code `202`.

| Output parameter | Type | Description | Value example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| submissionUID | String | Unique ID of the submission. 26 Latin alphanumeric symbols. |  |
| acceptedDocuments | [acceptedDocuments[]](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/#accepted-documents) | List of documents that are initially accepted (passed sync validations) together with their invoice code numbers and newly assigned IDs. |  |
| rejectedDocuments | [rejectedDocuments[]](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/#rejected-documents) | List of documents that are not accepted together with their invoice code numbers and error information. |  |

#### Accepted Documents

Accepted document response consists of:

| Output parameter | Type | Description | Value example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| uuid | String | Unique document ID assigned by e-Invoice. 26 Latin alphanumeric symbols. |  |
| invoiceCodeNumber | String | Document reference number used by Supplier for internal tracking purpose | INV12345, CN23456, DN34567 |

#### Rejected Documents

Rejected document response consists of:

| Output parameter | Type | Description | Value example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| invoiceCodeNumber | String | Document reference number used by Supplier for internal tracking purpose | INV12345, CN23456, DN34567 |
| error | [Error](/standard-error-response/#error-response-structure) | Error information detailing why the document was not accepted in this submission. |  |

#### Error Response

Error situations are reported back by this API through the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/).

Additional specialised error messages can be returned as a result of validation of documents:

| HTTP Status Code | Error Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | BadStructure | Returned when there is a structural error with the submission message. Either is not having the Documents included in a single Document tag or there are other elements that are not allowed. |
| 400 | MaximumSizeExceeded | Returned when the size of the submission exceeds allowed limit. Details including supported size in the [Error](#error) object in the body of the return message. It is expected that calling system creates smaller submissions and submit them one by one. |
| 403 | IncorrectSubmitter | Returned when submitter of the documents is trying to submit them on behalf of the other taxpayer. Also returned when intermediary is submitting documents on behalf of taxpayer, but they do not have such a permission. Details in the [Error](#error) object in the body of the return message. |
| 422 | DuplicateSubmission | Returned when an identical submission is detected based on the previous submissions sent by the same taxpayer within the past 10 minutes. Issuer can try submitting the same payload again based on the returned value in the response header `Retry-After` in seconds. Detection works on hashing the request payload and compare it with previous submissions. |

Additional considerations
-------------------------

The e-Invoice file size rules are as follows:

1. 5 MB maximum submission size;
2. 100 maximum e-Invoices per submission; and
3. 300 KB maximum per e-Invoice.

No restriction on the number of lines in an e-Invoice will be imposed, as long as the rules above are met.

Minification of XML/JSON Documents

In order to optimize document size and prevent potential validation errors, we recommend implementing minification techniques for XML and JSON documents submitted via the Submit Document API. This entails the compression of whitespace and unnecessary characters within the documents, effectively reducing their overall size without altering their content or structure.

Minification serves two primary purposes:

* ⁠*Size Optimization:* By eliminating unnecessary whitespace, line breaks, and indentation, the size of XML and JSON documents can be significantly reduced. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with large datasets or documents, helping to minimize bandwidth usage and improve overall system performance.
* *Validation Error Prevention:* Minification can help mitigate the risk of encountering validation errors, such as the 1,000 lines limitation. By reducing the overall line count of the documents, the likelihood of hitting such limits is diminished, ensuring smoother processing and transmission of data.

Implementing minification as part of the document submission process not only enhances the efficiency of data transfer but also contributes to a more robust and scalable system architecture. We encourage developers to incorporate minification techniques into their workflows when utilizing the Submit Document API, thereby optimizing performance and mitigating potential validation issues.

### Mapping Internal IDs to Assigned Ones

To support mapping of internal documents managed in taxpayer ERP system to documents issued or received through MyInvois System, taxpayers can supply their internal invoice identifiers (used in ERP solution) and also internal product identifiers for the goods sold or services rendered when submitting e-Invoice to LHDNM.

When MyInvois System returns back assigned unique IDs for document submission (containing one or more documents), each individual document accepted by the solution contains assigned e-Invoice ID, long unique ID used for the creation of validation link and internal document ID (that was supplied by the submitter).

### Throttling

Given large amounts of submissions coming from multiple taxpayers, it is recommended that taxpayers submit invoices in batches, it is important that ERP systems are not calling the API too frequently. Therefore, solution leverages throttling techniques configured by administrators. See [standard headers description](/standard-header-parameters/) to see headers that are returned in successful responses and [standard error response information](/standard-error-response/) for throttling error information.

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• The ERP system can submit multiple documents using batch processing. Each batch is able handle up to 100 documents, with a total size limit of 5 MB and a maximum document size of 300 KB. Submitting documents in batches rather than individually is recommended for efficiency.

• The ERP system should not keep re-submit the same submission repeatedly without considering the results received from the submission API. The submission APIs return the results of the initial processing, which should be reviewed before resending a submission. The system may impose limits on the usage policy of this API, which will be based on each client ID and linked to the specific ERP system using the APIs.

• The system allows for batch submissions of documents, accommodating up to 100 documents per batch, with a combined size limit of 5 MB and a maximum of 300 KB per document. Batch submissions of documents are recommended over individual submissions for increased efficiency.

• Avoid repeated submissions of the same document without considering the results from the initial submission API. The API provides immediate processing results, which should be reviewed prior to any resubmission. A threshold of 100 request per minute (RPM) for this API is advised.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.

Cancel Document
===============

This API allows issuer to cancel previously issued document, either self-induced cancellation or by accepting a rejection request made by the buyer.

[Submit Documents](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/)
[Reject Document](/einvoicingapi/04-reject-document/)

Overview
--------

Document cancellation is a way to correct submission errors that were noticed right away. Ideally, cancellation is done even before the document is fully validated and recipient is notified. Therefore, cancellation can be done only within limited time period from the validation of the document. This time limit is specific to document type and is returned by calling [Get Document Type API](/api/04-get-document-type/) and checking workflow parameters.

Cancellation is permitted within the 72-hour window from the date and time the document was marked as valid. If cancellation time has passed, taxpayers can revert / adjust the previously issued incorrect invoice through submission of a credit note/debit note/refund note (as the case may be).

**Note!** When you are logged in as intermediary, permissions that are granted by the taxpayer will be applied on your profile and this will control the functionalities that you'll be able to executed on behalf of the taxpayer you are representing.

Signature
---------

This is REST based API that receives the document ID through the URL parameter and state to be changed in request body.

### Successful Response

On a successful submission, this API returns `200` status code.

### Error Response

Error situations are reported back by this API through the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/).

Additional specialised error messages can be returned as a result of validation of state of the document and caller:

| HTTP Status Code | Error Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | OperationPeriodOver | Returned when user is trying to cancel document when the time limit of cancellation has already run out. |
| 400 | IncorrectState | Returned when caller is trying to cancel the document that might already be rejected or invalid. State transition in this case is not allowed. |
| 400 | ActiveReferencingDocuments | Returned when caller is trying to cancel the document that has been referenced by other documents, e.g., credit note referencing invoice. The required action is to first cancel the referencing document and followed by this one. |
| 403 | Forbidden | Returned when valid taxpayer system is trying to perform operation on a document not issued by them. |

Additional considerations
-------------------------

In case of self-billed invoices, the buyer actually cancels the document, not the supplier.

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• Please ensure the UUID is correct before attempting to cancel a submission to avoid unnecessary API calls.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.

Reject Document
===============

This API allows a buyer that received an invoice to reject it and request the supplier to cancel it.

[Cancel Document](/einvoicingapi/03-cancel-document/)
[Get Recent Documents](/einvoicingapi/05-get-recent-documents/)

Overview
--------

Document rejection is a way to quickly notify the supplier that there are some problems with the document they have issued, so that correction can be done as soon as possible. Rejection is allowed for recipient of the document only within limited time period from the time of validation of the document. This time limit is specific to document type and is returned by calling [Get Document Type API](/api/04-get-document-type/) and checking workflow parameters.

If allowed rejection time since validation has passed but the document is still considered incorrect, buyer need to notify issuers and they need to revert previously issued incorrect invoice through submission of a credit note/debit note/refund note (as the case may be).

Rejection is permitted within the 72-hour window from the date and time that the document was marked valid to be able to reject a document.

Rejection action for any document can happen only once.

### Error Response

Error situations are reported back by this API through the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/).

Additional considerations
-------------------------

This API is limited to retrieve only certain maximum number of documents and to query only certain “time window” of the documents to prevent huge queries to be executed. These maximum parameters are defined by e-Invoice system administrators.

Time window is a configurable parameter configured by Tax Authuority. Current configuration is **31 days**.

The maximum number of documents that can be returned by this endpoint is **10,000 documents**. You can use the various optional filters to get the desired documents results.

Receiver of the documents can retrieve documents that are in statuses `Valid` or `Cancelled`. If document exists, and is issued to given receiver, but status is `Submitted` or `Invalid`, document will not be part of the response. Issuer of the documents can retrieve documents in any status. The document validation or public URL can be created using below -

```
{envbaseurl}/uuid-of-document/share/longid
```

where {envbaseurl} need to be replaced with e-Invoice portal Base URL

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• The 'Get Recent Document' API should be used for troubleshooting issues and it was not designed for reconciliation between your ERP system and the MyInvois system. Excessive use of this API may result in throttling. The system may impose limits on the usage policy of this API. Which will be based on each client ID and will be linked to the specific ERP system using the APIs.

• Kindly note that the ‘Get Recent Documents’ API is intended to assist with troubleshooting issues, rather than for reconciliation between your ERP system and the MyInvois system. Excessive use of this API for purposes other than troubleshooting may result in system throttling.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.

### Error Response

Error situations are reported back by this API through the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/).

Additional considerations
-------------------------

Maximum page size allowed is defined by e-Invoice system administrators.

This API is available to issuers that are querying their submissions. This also includes authorized intermediaries (service providers) who submitted the documents on behalf of the taxpayer they represent.

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• Use the ‘Get Submission API’ to monitor the status of submissions and documents. Ensure a 3-5 second interval between requests to avoid system throttling, which may occur if too many requests are made for the same submission. These limits are based on each client ID and will be linked to the specific ERP system using the APIs.

• To prevent system overload and ensure optimal functionality, it is recommend to adjust the ‘Get Submission’ API calls to a polling interval of 3-5 seconds, with a maximum rate of 300 request per minute (RPM).

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.

### Error Response

Error situations are reported back by this API through the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/).

Additional considerations
-------------------------

To get the unique ID that will be used to call this API, taxpayer system can first call API returning list of [recent documents](/einvoicingapi/05-get-recent-documents/).

Receiver of the documents can retrieve documents that are in “Valid” or “Cancelled” status. If document exists, and is issued to given receiver, but status is “submitted” or “invalid”, not found code will be returned.

Issuer of the documents can retrieve documents in any status. The document validation or public URL can be created using below -

```
{envbaseurl}/uuid-of-document/share/longid
```

where {envbaseurl} need to be replaced with MyInvois portal Base URL

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• Repeated invocation of this API to retrieve document details can lead to unnecessary system load and inefficiency. Instead, maintain a local copy of the documents. This ensures documents can be accessed when needed without frequent API calls, thereby improving system performance and reducing overhead.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.

**Important !**

• Use the Get Document Details API only to retrieve error details or exceptions in invalid documents. For checking submission status , utilise the 'Get Submission API' with a polling frequency of 3-5 seconds. Excessive requests for the same document may result in throttling. The system may impose usage limits on this API. Which will be based on each client ID and will therefore be linked to the specific ERP system utilising the APIs.

• Kindly note that the ‘Get Document Details’ API should be used exclusively for retrieving error information or exceptions related to invalid documents. For status updates, please use the ‘Get Submission’ API and adhere to a polling frequency of 3-5 seconds to avoid system throttling.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.

Search Documents
================

This API allows taxpayer's systems to search the documents sent or received which are available on the MyInvois System using various filters.

[Get Document Details](/einvoicingapi/08-get-document-details/)
[Search Taxpayer's TIN](/einvoicingapi/10-search-taxpayer-tin/)

Overview
--------

The Search Documents API has various enhanced filters for precise queries and provides access to large result set in a paginated way.

Search documents allows users to query the system and return list of documents that have been received or issued.

To invoke this API, users must provide values for either the `submissionDateFrom` and `submissionDateTo` filter parameters or the `issueDateFrom` and `issueDateTo` filter parameters. Users can combine these optional filters in various ways to obtain precise results.

Results will be returned in a paginated format based on the specified `pageSize`, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of results.

**Note**: The values of the input filter parameters should remain consistent when requesting subsequent pages of results.

Days difference between `submissionDateFrom` and `submissionDateTo` filter parameters, and `issueDateFrom` and `issueDateTo` filter parameters should not exceed a configured number of days set by e-Invoice system administrators (Current configuration is 31 days).

Results list is ordered based on registration date of the submission descending (newest documents submitted into the e-Invoice system appear first).

### Throttling and Rate limiting

To allow consistent performance for all taxpayers using e-Invoice API and prevent overuse of resources, this API has throttling limits set per taxpayer (current configuration is **1 Request every 5 Seconds**). The throttling limit is subject to change by e-Invoice system administrators.

See the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/) for more details when your calls to the API are throttled.

### Error Response

Error situations are reported back by this API through the [standard error response](/standard-error-response/).

Additional considerations
-------------------------

Days difference between `submissionDateFrom` and `submissionDateTo` filter parameters, and `issueDateFrom` and `issueDateTo` filter parameters are currently configured to 31 days. Days difference value can be changed by e-Invoice system administrators.

There are maximum number of 10,000 documents that can be returned by this endpoint. You can use the various optional filters to get the desired documents results.

Receiver of the documents can retrieve documents that are in statuses `Valid` or `Cancelled`. If document exists, and is issued to given receiver, but status is `Submitted` or `Invalid`, document will not be part of the response. Issuer of the documents can retrieve documents in any status. The document validation or public URL can be created using below -

```
{envbaseurl}/uuid-of-document/share/longid
```

where {envbaseurl} need to be replaced with MyInvois portal Base URL

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• Search document API is designed for your manual auditing requirements and also for troubleshooting issues. This API shouldn't be used for ERP system reconciliation implementation with the MyInvois system. Excessive requests for this API may result in throttling. System may impose limits on the usage policy of this API. These limits will be based on each client ID and hence would be linked to the specific ERP system using the APIs.

• Optimise search queries by applying specific filters and parameters to narrow down the results, improving the efficiency of your searches. Avoid making repetitive searches with identical criteria, and where applicable, cache the results to reduce redundant API calls.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.

This API returns HTTP status code `404` (Not Found) if no TIN is found for the given set of search parameters.

Notes
-----

**Important !**

• This API should be used to Search for TIN before this is used to submit the documents. This should be cached from the ERP system side so that to reduce the calls occurring on this API. Excessive requests for this API may result in throttling and would be treated as malicious activity in this case. System may impose limits on the usage policy of this API. These limits will be based on each client ID and hence would be linked to the specific ERP system using the APIs.

• API would return one and only one search result and if more than one result can be found matching the search criteria then the API would return an error as described above to the caller.

• It is advised to perform validation of buyer's TINs when the buyer entity is being defined in your ERP system and once validated reflect this in your ERP system to make sure there is no need to recall the same API repeatedly.

• It is not advised to call this API before every document submission as in this case this may result in these calls being flagged and throttled as well.

• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.

How to retrieve and validate the accuracy of my TIN?
----------------------------------------------------

To facilitate the retrieval of Tax Identification Number (TIN), there are multiple channels available for taxpayers:

• Check the TIN via the [MyTax](https://mytax.hasil.gov.my/) Portal (e-Daftar or Your Profile Information).  
• Validate the TIN via the [Validate Taxpayer’s TIN](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/einvoicingapi/01-validate-taxpayer-tin/) API before submitting e-Invoice.  
• Contact the HASiL Contact Centre (03-8911 1000); or visit the nearest LHDNM offices.

**For Individual TIN (with prefix IG):**

• The new prefix for individual TIN is now ‘IG’ (replacing ‘OG’ or ‘SG’). For example, if the TIN is ‘SG123456789’, please input it as ‘IG123456789’.  
• The numeric character within the TIN remains unchanged, with a maximum length of 14 characters including the prefix.

**For Non-Individual TIN (with prefix C, CS, D, F, FA, PT, TA, TC, TN, TR, TP, J & LE):**

• If your TIN begins with a zero ’0’ after the prefix, please remove any initial zeros after the prefix for successful validation. For example, if the TIN is ‘C01234567890’, please input it as ‘C1234567890’.  
• If your TIN does not end with a zero ‘0’ (e.g., C123456789), please ensure you add an additional zero ’0’ at the end (e.g., C1234567890). Please note that Non-Individual TIN always ends with zero ‘0’.

What are the environment URLs?
------------------------------

| Env | Invoicing Portal | System API | Identity Service |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PROD | myinvois.hasil.gov.my | api.myinvois.hasil.gov.my | api.myinvois.hasil.gov.my |
| SANDBOX | preprod.myinvois.hasil.gov.my | preprod-api.myinvois.hasil.gov.my | preprod-api.myinvois.hasil.gov.my |

What are the various document statuses within the e-Invoice workflow?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The invoice is stored in the local database with a specific status. The status is an integer value, which could be one of the following:

| Status | Value | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Submitted | 1 | This means the invoice has passed initial structure validations but is still pending additional validations to be completed |
| Valid | 2 | The status of a successful invoice validation |
| Invalid | 3 | The status of a submitted invoice with validation issues |
| Cancelled | 4 | The status of an invoice cancelled by the issuer |

Application Programming Interface (API)
=======================================

---

How to get sample payload?
--------------------------

You can download the JSON and XML [Sample](/sample) payloads for various document types and scenarios from the Sample page.

What is the Rate Limit for each API?
------------------------------------

The rate limiting functionality implementation is using the standard HTTP rate limiting headers. Refer [here](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices/#rate-limit) for the rate limit for each API. Hence, the caller should handle the rate limiting headers that are returned to them by the API and retry the call as per these headers. The header would specify the current number of calls that are rate limited and the time period the caller should wait before they make the next call. Please, refer back [Standard Headers Parameters](/standard-header-parameters/) to standard rate limiting headers definition.

Common observations:

1. Login Too Frequent - The system token is valid for 60 minutes. Use this token for API operations rather than generating a new one for each request. Kindly refer to [Login as Taxpayer Notes](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/api/07-login-as-taxpayer-system/#notes) for more details.
2. High Volume Submissions – To maintain system stability, usage limits will be enforced on the Submit Documents. It is therefore advisable to submit e-Invoices in batches and in accordance with the applicable rate limits to prevent potential disruptions. Kindly refer to [Submit Document Notes](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/#notes) for more details.

What are the Supplier/Buyer Information Field Validation?
---------------------------------------------------------

| No | Field | Validation Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| i | Supplier/Buyer Name | 1) Cannot exceed 300 characters |
| ii | Email Address | 1) Must follow valid format (RFC 5321 & RFC 5322)  2) Maximum 320 characters  3) No space between the characters  4) If no email, just leave it blank |
| iii | Phone Number | 1) Minimum 8 and maximum 20 characters  2) Only allow optional plus (+) symbol at the front of the number  3) No space between the digits |
| iv | Address (Line 1-3) | 1) Maximum 150 characters for every line |
| v | City Name | 1) Maximum 50 characters |
| vi | Postal Code | 1) If country is Malaysia, maximum 5-digit numbers only  2) Country other than Malaysia, maximum is 50 alphanumeric characters including special characters |
| vii | SST Number | 1) Maximum 35 characters  2) Only allows dash (-) and semicolon (;) special characters  3) Up to 2 SST numbers separated by semicolon (;)  4) Allows ‘NA’ value if no SST number |
| viii | TTX Number | 1) Maximum 17 characters  2) Only allows dash (-) special character  3) Allows ‘NA’ value if no TTX number |

Kindly refer to [Document Type](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/types/) structure page for more details.

How to Validate TIN using Validate Taxpayer TIN API in Sandbox Environment via Postman
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Choose Sandbox Environment on the top-right option of Postman.
2. Login using Login as Taxpayer/Intermediary System API and configure the generated access token accordingly.
3. Use the correct format of the API URL and a valid value for TIN, idType and idValue
   Example: [GET]
   `https:///api/v1.0/taxpayer/validate/C12*******0?idType=BRN/NRIC/PASSPORT/ARMY&idValue=19********1`.

Which login API should be used by the Taxpayer or Intermediary?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Taxpayers should use the Login as Taxpayer System when submitting their own documents. However, taxpayers who act as service providers, submitting documents on behalf of their customers, should use the Login as Intermediary System.

How to hash the “documentHash” value and encode the “document” value?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The XML/JSON document is hashed using SHA-256 to create the “documentHash” value. The same XML/JSON document would need to be encoded in Base64 to generate the “document” value.

How can the file size of an XML document be reduced if it exceeds the 300KB submission limit?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For cases where an invoice exceeds the 300KB size limit, you may use minification. Minification refers to the process of reducing the size of a file or code without changing its functionality. By removing unnecessary whitespace, comments, and formatting, minification significantly reduces the overall file size while preserving the original functionality of the invoice.

How can I submit a single Credit / Debit / Refund Note that includes multiple Original e-Invoice Reference Numbers (i.e. UUID) through API?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To submit a single Credit / Debit / Refund Note (including self-billed) with multiple UUID through API, please refer to the guidance below:

1. XML file: To add the second Original e-invoice reference, taxpayer will need to add a new line at Billing Reference. It cannot be inserted under the same InvoiceDocumentReference.  
   Example:
   ![faqSampleXML](/images/faq-sample-xml.png)
2. JSON file: To add the second Original e-invoice reference in JSON document, taxpayer will need to add a new line at InvoiceDocumentReference.   
   Example:
     
   ![faqSampleJSON](/images/faq-sample-json.png)

What are the differences in printing capabilities between submissions made via API and those made through the MyInvois Portal?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

e-Invoices submitted via the API cannot be printed directly from the MyInvois Portal. The printing feature is only available for e-Invoices that are manually submitted through the MyInvois Portal.

Integration Practices
=====================

---

What are the best practices to integrate with API?
--------------------------------------------------

Refer to this page for more information [Integration-practices](/integration-practices/).

Should I use a different Client ID and Client Secret for the Production and Sandbox environments?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you will need to use a different Client ID and Client Secret for each environment. Please refer to the steps on how to obtain Client ID and Client Secret via the MyInvois Portal.

How to obtain Client ID and Client Secret?
------------------------------------------

Taxpayers may self-provision to obtain the client ID and client secret via the MyInvois Portal. The user guide available on the MyInvois Portal under “View and Register ERP” provides guidance to taxpayers on how to perform the self-provisioning.

What is the reason for having two Client Secrets?
-------------------------------------------------

Maintaining two client secrets provides redundancy, with both expiring simultaneously. If one is compromised, the other remains valid, ensuring uninterrupted access and security.

What are UBL JSON Value Mappings?
---------------------------------

In the UBL JSON, every attribute value should be paired with a key “\_” to be compliant with UBL.  
For Example: value for InvoiceTypeCode should be represented as “\_” : “02” which refers to the Credit Note Invoice Type code.

How to handle special characters in XML and JSON documents when submitting e-invoices?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For XML document, the following characters need to be replaced with their corresponding escape sequences:

| XML Special Characters | Syntax | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| < | `&lt;` | Less than |
| > | `&gt;` | Greater than |
| & | `&amp;` | Ampersand |
| ” | `&quot;` | Double quote |
| ’ | `&apos;` | Single quote |

For JSON document, the following characters need to be replaced with their corresponding escape sequences:

| JSON Special Characters | Syntax | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ” | `\"` | Double quote |
| \ | `\\` | Backslash |
| / | `\/` | Forward slash |
|  | `\b` | Backspace |
|  | `\f` | Form feed |
|  | `\n` | Newline |
|  | `\r` | Carriage return |
|  | `\t` | Tab |

Which Client ID and Client Secret should Intermediaries utilise to submit on behalf of Taxpayers?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intermediaries should use their own Client ID and Client Secret to submit on behalf of Taxpayers.

How to get validation link and generate QR code?
------------------------------------------------

The QR code (quick response code) can be generated from the validation link using any QR code generator. The validation link can be created using the format below:

`{envbaseurl}/uuid-of-document/share/longid`

The {envbaseurl} will need to be replaced with e-Invoice portal Base URL. The UUID and long ID can both be obtained as return parameters for Get Submission, Get Document or Get Document Detail API.

Will intermediaries be allowed to view and retrieve e-Invoices received by the taxpayers?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to privacy regulations and confidentiality considerations, intermediaries will only be allowed to view and access e-Invoices that they have submitted on behalf of taxpayers. Intermediaries are not permitted to access or retrieve e-Invoices submitted independently by taxpayers or e-Invoices received by taxpayers.

How to get sample payload?
--------------------------

You can download the JSON and XML [Sample](/sample) payloads for various document types and scenarios from the Sample page.

How to test APIs via Postman?
-----------------------------

The guidance on how to test the API’s can be found on the [Postman](/postman) Page.

How to get sample response from each API?
-----------------------------------------

You can download the JSON collection file from the [Postman](/postman) page for the sample JSON request. Then, follow the steps on how to test the APIs to get the response for each APIs.

What are the code and value required for tax exemption?
-------------------------------------------------------

The Software Development Kit (SDK) page and Postman have been updated on 24 May 2024. Tax Exemption code ‘E’ is now added into SDK for Tax Type code. The real value should correspond to the tax type code available at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/codes/tax-types](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/codes/tax-types/).

What to do if an Error 400 code appears in API when validating taxpayers’ TIN number?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This API returns HTTP status code `400`(BadArgument) if the TIN or any of the input parameters does not match the argument structure. Taxpayers need to check their TIN number format is correct.

What action should be taken if the API displays an error message stating “Unauthorized” or indicates a status of “401 Unauthorized”?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The error occurred because the generated access token expired after its one-hour validity period. To resolve this, a new access token must be generated using the “Login as Taxpayer” or “Login as Intermediary” API once again.

What action should be taken when I encounter Error Code 429 which indicates “Too many requests” on an API?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This issue occurred because the system received too many requests on the API that the taxpayer is using. The taxpayer can resolve this by attempting to use the API again after a brief period.

Can an e-Invoice be issued with a negative value?
-------------------------------------------------

Yes. Negative values are allowed for fields within Document Submission.

Is there a limit to the number of buyer email addresses that can be added to the e-Invoice?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, The MyInvois System supports a single email as long as the field does not exceed the field size limit of 320 characters.

How does the system validate if a document is a duplicate?
----------------------------------------------------------

The system identifies duplicate e-Invoices by comparing the following fields using the AND operator:

1. e-Invoice type and type version
2. Issuance date and time
3. Internal ID or invoice number
4. Supplier TIN (for normal e-Invoices)
5. Buyer TIN (for self-billed e-Invoices)

This ensures that an e-Invoice is flagged as a duplicate only if it matches all the above criteria with another e-Invoice already processed by the system within a 2-hour period.

Digital Signature
=================

---

Where can taxpayers obtain guidance on Digital Signature?
---------------------------------------------------------

The comprehensive guidance on Digital Signature creation and validation can be found on the [Signature](/signature/) page.

How to acquire Digital Signature?
---------------------------------

The issuer of the documents will have to use a valid digital certificate that is issued by a certificate authority (CA) in Malaysia as documented here [List of Certification Authorities and Recognition](https://www.mcmc.gov.my/en/sectors/digital-signature/list-of-licensees).

You may also obtain the digital signature sample from this link:  
• UBL 2.1 Invoice Sample XML with Signature: [https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/files/one-doc-signed.xml](/files/one-doc-signed.xml).  
• UBL 2.1 Invoice Sample JSON with Signature: [https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/files/sample-ul-invoice-2.1-signed.min.json](/files/sample-ul-invoice-2.1-signed.min.json).

Disclaimer: The sample JSON file is for digital signature illustration purposes only. Taxpayers are advised to consult local laws and regulations for guidance on digital signature implementation.

Which version of Document Types should taxpayers use to test and validate Digital Signature in the Sandbox environment?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both versions v1.0 and v1.1 are available on the Sandbox. Taxpayers interested in testing and validating Digital Signature should use v1.1 for their Sandbox testing.

What are the key differences between version 1.1 and version 1.0?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Digital signature can only be validated in version 1.1.

Why was version 1.1 introduced?
-------------------------------

To allow taxpayers to test the digital signature validation after submitting invoice in the Sandbox environment.

Do I need to submit the documents in version 1.0 and version 1.1?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Taxpayers are given the option to decide to submit documents in version 1.0 or version 1.1 depending on testing requirements. If taxpayers intend to test digital signature, it is recommended to submit using version 1.1. Version 1.0 is available for submission of documents without digital signature validation.

Is the submission using Document Version 1.0 allowed to be used for submission on 1 August 2024 onwards?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taxpayers may submit documents using document version 1.0 without the requirement for digital signature validation until such time as the Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri Malaysia (LHDNM) issues an official notice concerning the retirement of version 1.0. Nonetheless, it is strongly recommended that taxpayers adopt version 1.1, which incorporates digital signature validation, to ensure the authenticity of the supplier’s identity.

How do I ensure the digitally signed document created is valid?
---------------------------------------------------------------

You can refer to the Signature Validation section in the Signature page <https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/signature/> on how to digitally sign the document, adhering to the digital signing creation requirements and validation rules for signature.

How can I get a valid digital certificate for my organisation?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The certificates must be issued by the certificates authority as listed in the MCMC website at <https://www.mcmc.gov.my/en/sectors/digital-signature/list-of-licensees>.

What type of digital certificate do I need to procure?
------------------------------------------------------

Both Soft and Roaming certificates can be used for MyInvois purpose, depending on your system configuration. Soft certificate is installed in local machine, while Roaming certificate is installed in Server.

For companies that have subsidiaries, does digital certificate need to be registered for each subsidiary?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subsidiaries have the option to independently procure their own digital certificates for document submission. Alternatively, the headquarters can designate one subsidiary as an intermediary tasked with registering and managing digital certificates for the entire organization, including all subsidiaries.

As a service provider, what type of certificate do I need to procure to submit documents that are digitally signed?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The service provider can procure either Soft or Roaming certificates for MyInvois purpose, depending on the system configuration. Soft certificate is installed in local machine, while Roaming certificate is installed in Server.

As a service provider, do I need a different certificate for each customer I am representing?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. Service providers can use their own certificate to submit document for all their customers.

Which digital certificate is required for document submission via API: an individual’s or an organisation’s?”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For submission through API, an organisation digital certificate is required.

Do I need to renew a digital certificate?
-----------------------------------------

Yes. The digital certificate has an expiration date. You would need to confirm with the CA that issued the certificate on the expiration date.

Technical Support and Error Handling
====================================

---

What action should be taken when I encounter the submission error “Issuance date time value of the document is too old and cannot be submitted”?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If it pertains to the Submit Document API, review the “propertyPath” for detailed information and adjust the date to ensure it is within 72 hours before submission.

What should I do if I encounter the error “Document issuance date and time is in the future”?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The provided date and time format does not comply with the required UTC standard. To resolve this issue, ensure that the issuance date and time in your document are formatted correctly according to the UTC standard.

What should be done if the submission error message “The authenticated TIN and documents TIN is not matching” occurs?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kindly verify the following scenarios:

1. When using Login as Taxpayer API - the issuer TIN in the document must match with the TIN associated with the Client ID and Client Secret.
2. When using Login as Intermediary System API – the issuer TIN in the document must match with the TIN of the taxpayer the intermediary is representing.
3. For sole proprietors, taxpayers can now validate TINs starting with “IG” along with their BRN. To do so, taxpayers must ensure the “Business Owner” role is assigned in their MyTax profile.

Why am I receiving a “403 - Forbidden” error when trying to access the Sandbox Environment using the Login as Taxpayer API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The “403 - Forbidden” error typically occurs when the incorrect Client ID and Client Secret are used. Please note that credentials from the production portal cannot be used in the sandbox environment. To resolve this issue, you need to register your company in the pre-production portal and then register your ERP system. This will allow you to obtain the correct Client ID and Client Secret for accessing the sandbox environment.

Why am I receiving an error message “Invalid Structure” when submitting e-Invoice through the API?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The “Invalid Structure” error message usually appears due to an incorrect sequence of elements in your submission. To resolve this issue, please ensure your submission adheres to the correct format. For reference, please refer to the following sections of the SDK:

* MyInvois Sample Format:
  <https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/sample/>
* MyInvois Document Data Structure:
  <https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/types/>

Why am I receiving the error stating “ItemCode 00 was not active when document issued”?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The error message “ItemCode 00 was not active when document issued” indicates that the item code ‘00’ was either not defined, inactive, or incorrectly configured in the system’s item master data at the time the e-invoice was submitted. This means the system could not validate the item as active, which is a requirement for successful document processing.

Additionally, please note that the use of state code ‘00’ is no longer valid for issuing e-invoices via API or Batch Upload and refer to the SDK at the following link for the correct list of state codes: https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/codes/state-codes/

* [Validations](/document-validation-rules/)
* [FAQ](/faq/)
* [Contacts](/contacts/)

Integration Practices
=====================

This page explains about the Integration Practices that will help users to integrate with the API.

[Postman](/postman/)

Content
=======

The solution supports multiple integration options, but it is important to integrate following the below guidance to make sure your integration is behaving correctly and you would be able to get the most benefits of the solution.

Polling Approach
================

In this integration approach, the ERP system would submit documents using one of the submission APIs and then continue to check the status of these submitted documents using one of the submission APIs and the reference of the submission that was generated from the system.

**Note!**
Please note the following key points in the above flow diagram:

[Login as Taxpayer](/api/07-login-as-taxpayer-system/)

* Login is performed and access tokens should be cached for the lifetime of the token (this is default to be valid for 60 minutes).
* If login fails, then issue should be investigated and resolved.

[Submit documents](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/)

* Once invoice documents are submitted, then the ERP system should wait for a period of time depending on the size of your submission before checking with the e-invoicing system if the submission has been completed or not.

  The submission API returns a submission ID that can be used to check the status of the submission as per below.

[Get Submission](/einvoicingapi/06-get-submission/)

* In order to check the Submission status, use the submission UID along with Get Submission API:
* Once the submission has been completely processed then the documents are updated in your internal ERP system accordingly.

Common Integration Anti-patterns
================================

The following are key practices that should be avoided when implementing the integration with the e-invoicing system as these practices might impact the integrity of the data received and would increase the load over your ERP system.

1. Acquiring a new authentication token with every API call to the system.

   Received authentication tokens remain valid for a duration that is already specified in the response of the authentication API as per below.

   By default, these token are valid for 60 minutes and hence can be used by any system APIs that requires such a token while the token is still valid.
2. Getting the status of the submission by checking the status of each document submitted within the submission by any of the APIs “Get Recent Documents”, “Search Documents”, “Get Document” or “Get Document Details”. These APIs are designed to be used for documents retrieval after submission and validation and not during the submission operation as per the above workflows.
3. Re-submitting the same submission over and over again without regards to the results received from the submission APIs.

   The submission APIs returns results of initial processing of the submission and hence these should be used and checked before the submission is sent again.

   In fact, resending the same submission should not be performed in all cases except in case of error received from the submission APIs.

   Otherwise, any of the 20x response statuses should be accepted by your system and in this case the submission shouldn’t be resubmitted again as it will be automatically flagged as duplicate submission and in these cases the submission APIs might start to throttling calls being received from your ERP system.
4. The calls to “Get Recent Documents” should be in most cases be fulfilled by the more optimized API “Search Documents”.

   Calling the API “Get Recent Documents” is subject to being throttled as well.
5. Calling of the authentication API on the path “/connect/token” without supplying the required parameters such as the “client\_id”, “grant\_type”, or “client\_secret”; would not add any value to your system as these calls will be automatically blocked by the system.

   These include cases such as sending the “client\_id” with wrong (‘0’ or ‘**YOUR\_CLIENT\_ID**’) or empty values.

Rate Limit
==========

Rate limiting controls API usage spikes by restricting the number of calls allowed within a specified time frame. If the limit is exceeded, a “429 Too Many Requests” response status code is returned to the caller. The information below outlines the intended limits and serves as an educational resource for your API integration.

| API | Requests Per Minute (RPM)/ Client Id |
| --- | --- |
| Login as Taxpayer System | 12 |
| Login as Intermediary System | 12 |
| Submit Documents | 100 |
| Get Submission | 300 |
| Cancel Document | 12 |
| Reject Document | 12 |
| Get Document | 60 |
| Get Document Details | 125 |
| Get Recent Documents | 12 |
| Search Documents | 12 |
| Search Taxpayer’s TIN | 60 |
| Taxpayer’s QR Code | 60 |

**What Happens When Limits Are Exceeded?**

When the rate limit for an API endpoint is exceeded:

• The server will return a “429 Too Many Requests” status code. Please refer error response. [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/standard-error-response](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/standard-error-response/)  
• The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait before retrying.

**Note:** Please note that the sandbox environment is intended for functional testing and has a lower API rate limit compared to the production environment, effective 28 April 2025. Additionally, data in the sandbox environment will be retained for a maximum of 3 months, after which it will be permanently deleted. Please ensure to back up any important data before the retention period expires.

Polling Approach for Document Submission
========================================

The pseudo-code provided below outlines a process for submitting documents in base64 format via an API call (SubmitDocuments) and subsequently polling another API (GetSubmission) to check the submission status.

The submitDocuments function initiates the submission process, returning a unique submission identifier. The pollSubmissionStatus function continuously checks the status of the submission until the status becomes valid or invalid.

The main function orchestrates these steps, encoding the document, submitting it, polling for submission status, and processing them accordingly.

This structured approach facilitates efficient document submission and status handling within an application or system.

```
// Main function to orchestrate the process
function main():
// Step 1: Login as Taxpayer System
token = getTokenFromLoginEndpoint(clientId, clientSecret)
// Cache the token based on expires_in response parameter
// Step 2: Submit documents
base64Document = encodeDocumentToBase64()
requestBody = appendBase64TorequestBody()
submissionUID = submitDocuments(requestBody, token)
// Step 3: Poll for Submission Status
submissionStatus = pollSubmissionStatus(submissionUID)
// Step 4: Process further

// Define function to submit documents via SubmitDocuments API
function submitDocuments(requestBody, token):
response = callSubmitDocumentsAPI(requestBody, token)
submissionUID = response.submissionUID
return submissionUID

// Define function to poll GetSubmission API for Submission Status
function pollSubmissionStatus(submissionUID):
inProgress = true
while inProgress is true:
    submission = callDocumentSubmissionsAPI(submissionUID)
    submissionStatus = submission.overallStatus
    if submissionStatus.isInProgress:
        waitForSomeTime()            
    else:
        inProgress = false
        return submissionStatus
```

How to test APIs via Postman?
=============================

For those that are using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to do quick tests and see how the APIs should be called both on identity service and actual document exchange, please use the Postman collection [e-Invoice SDK.postman\_collection.json](/files/EInvoicing SDK.postman_collection.json) (right-click to Save ) and use Postman as per the environment below (right-click to Save ).

| Environment | Postman Env. File |
| --- | --- |
| PROD | [PROD Env.postman\_environment.json](/files/PROD Env.postman_environment.json) |
| SANDBOX | [Sandbox Env.postman\_environment.json](/files/SANDBOX Env.postman_environment.json) |

To install the environments file, follow these steps:

1. On the top right-hand corner, click on the gear icon named `Manage Environments`

Step 1: Transform the document
------------------------------

The document will be required to be transformed by performing the following:  
• Removing the sections “UBLExtensions”, and “Signature” if they do exist.  
• Minify the file by removing new lines and not needed spaces.  
The output of this step would be a transformed document. The input document shown above once transformed it should be as per the below JSON file.

```

Step 2: Calculate the document digest
-------------------------------------

The next step is to calculate the document digest to be signed using the certificate. The document digest is calculated using the following steps.

```
// assume document is loaded in the variable document
using (SHA256 sha256 = SHA256.Create())
{
  var hash = sha256.ComputeHash(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(document));
  var docdigest = Convert.ToBase64String(hash);
}
```

Step 3: Sign the document digest using the certificate
------------------------------------------------------

The next step is to sign the property **docdigest** that is calculated in the previous step. This should be performed by loading the certificate to be used to sign the document as per the certificate generation guidance. Then use this certificate to sign the document digest value.

The following is example pseudo code that shows how this can be performed.

```
X509Certificate2 cert = new X509Certificate2();
// Load the certificate from the file store or the key store as required
RSACryptoServiceProvider privateKeyProvider = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)cert.PrivateKey;
var sign = privateKeyProvider.SignHash(hash, HashAlgorithmName.SHA256, RSASignaturePadding.Pkcs1);
var signature = Convert.ToBase64String(sign);
```

Step 4: Calculate the certificate digest
----------------------------------------

The next step is to calculate the certificate digest value. The following is example pseudo code that shows how this can be performed.

```
X509Certificate cert = new X509Certificate();
// Load the certificate from the file store or the key store as required
var certash = cert.GetCertHash(System.Security.Cryptography.HashAlgorithmName.SHA256);
var certdigest = Convert.ToBase64String(certash);
```

Step 5: Populate the signed properties section
----------------------------------------------

The next step is to populate the signed properties section using the values that are already calculated previously. A sample of the output for the signed properties section for the input sample document as per below.

```
"SignedProperties": [
  {
    "Id": "id-xades-signed-props",
    "SignedSignatureProperties": [
      {
        "SigningTime": [
          {
            "_": "2024-07-23T15:14:54Z"
          }
        ],
        "SigningCertificate": [
          {
            "Cert": [
              {
                "CertDigest": [
                  {
                    "DigestMethod": [
                      {
                        "_": "",
                        "Algorithm": "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256"
                      }
                    ],
                    "DigestValue": [
                      {
                        "_": "KKBSTyiPKGkGl1AFqcPziKCEIDYGtnYUTQN4ukO7G40="
                      }
                    ]
                  }
                ],
                "IssuerSerial": [
                  {
                    "X509IssuerName": [
                      {
                        "_": "CN=Trial LHDNM Sub CA V1, OU=Terms of use at http://www.posdigicert.com.my, O=LHDNM, C=MY"
                      }
                    ],
                    "X509SerialNumber": [
                      {
                        "_": "162880276254639189035871514749820882117"
                      }
                    ]
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Step 6: Calculate the signed properties section digest
------------------------------------------------------

The signed properties section that is prepared in the previous is then used to calculate the digest. This has to be performed by taking the outer content of the signed properties section and minify the section. The following is an example of the signed properties section that would be then used to calculate the signed properties section digest from the sample already provided above.

```
{"Target":"signature","SignedProperties":[{"Id":"id-xades-signed-props","SignedSignatureProperties":[{"SigningTime":[{"_":"2024-07-23T15:14:54Z"}],"SigningCertificate":[{"Cert":[{"CertDigest":[{"DigestMethod":[{"_":"","Algorithm":"http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256"}],"DigestValue":[{"_":"KKBSTyiPKGkGl1AFqcPziKCEIDYGtnYUTQN4ukO7G40="}]}],"IssuerSerial":[{"X509IssuerName":[{"_":"CN=Trial LHDNM Sub CA V1, OU=Terms of use at http://www.posdigicert.com.my, O=LHDNM, C=MY"}],"X509SerialNumber":[{"_":"162880276254639189035871514749820882117"}]}]}]}]}]}]}
```

Then this content is used to calculate the digest of this content which would be the signed properties section digest value.

The following is example pseudo code that shows how this can be performed.

```
// assume signedprops is loaded in the variable signedprops
using (SHA256 sha256 = SHA256.Create())
{
  var signedpropshash = sha256.ComputeHash(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(signedprops));
  var signedpropsdigest = Convert.ToBase64String(signedpropshash);
}
```

Step 7: Create the signed JSON document
---------------------------------------

Using the properties and digests calculated in the previous steps the sections “UBLExtensions”, and “Signature”. The following is an example of the “UBLExtensions” section content given the sample that is provided above.

```
"UBLExtensions": [
  {
    "UBLExtension": [
      {
        "ExtensionURI": [
          {
            "_": "urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:dsig:enveloped:xades"
          }
        ],
        "ExtensionContent": [
          {
            "UBLDocumentSignatures": [
              {
                "SignatureInformation": [
                  {
                    "ID": [
                      {
                        "_": "urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:signature:1"
                      }
                    ],
                    "ReferencedSignatureID": [
                      {
                        "_": "urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:signature:Invoice"
                      }
                    ],
                    "Signature": [
                      {
                        "Id": "signature",
                        "Object": [

                              {
                                "Target": "signature",
                                "SignedProperties": [
                                  {
                                    "Id": "id-xades-signed-props",
                                    "SignedSignatureProperties": [
                                      {
                                        "SigningTime": [
                                          {
                                            "_": "2024-07-23T15:14:54Z"
                                          }
                                        ],
                                        "SigningCertificate": [
                                          {
                                            "Cert": [
                                              {

The following is an example of the “Signature” section given the sample that is provided above.

```
"Signature": [
  {
    "ID": [
      {
        "_": "urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:signature:Invoice"
      }
    ],
    "SignatureMethod": [
      {
        "_": "urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:dsig:enveloped:xades"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The final signed document should be already minified including all the content to make sure the document is still valid according to the signature and the signature doesn’t break. The following is a sample of the output signed document including all the sections.

Document Signature Creation
===========================

Page describes the the algorithm of how signatures for documents submitted should be created.

High-Level Process
==================

The overall steps to take when preparing a single document for submission are:

* **Step 1:** Create document XML or JSON (no signature elements yet) for a single document
* **Step 2:** Apply transformations to the document
* **Step 3:** Canonicalize the document and generate the document hash (digest) (property reference **DocDigest**)
* **Step 4:** Sign the document digest (property reference **Sig**)
* **Step 5:** Generate the certificate hash (Digest) (property reference **CertDigest**)
* **Step 6:** Populate the signed properties section
* **Step 7:** Generate Signed Properties Hash (Digest) (property reference **PropsDigest**)
* **Step 8:** Populate the information in the document to create the signed document

Detailed Steps
==============

Step 2: Apply transformations to the document
---------------------------------------------

1. Make sure the source document is in the UTF-8 format.
2. Remove the XML version.
3. Remove the not required elements if any exists (UBLExtension (XPath: *[local-name()=׳Invoice׳]//*[local-name()=׳UBLExtensions׳]), and Signature (XPath: *[local-name()=׳Invoice׳]//*[local-name()=׳Signature׳]))

Step 3: Canonicalize the document and generate the document hash (digest)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Prepare document canonical version, to be used for signing:
   * XML format - apply [xml-c14n11](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n11/) canonicalization to the document
   * JSON format - minify the document by removing following elements from it:
     + Whitespaces
     + Line breaks
     + Comments
2. Hash the canonicalized document invoice body using SHA-256.
   * Use a HEX-to-Base64 encoder to encode the hashed value and convert it to base 64.
3. The output will be set as the value of the property **DocDigest**

Step 4: Sign the document digest
--------------------------------

1. Sign the generated invoice hash with RSA-SHA256 using the signing certificate private key
2. The output will be set as the value of the property **Sig**
3. Encode the hashed property tag using Base64 Encoder

Step 5: Generate the certificate hash
-------------------------------------

1. Hash the signing certificate using SHA-256
2. Encode the certificate hash using Base64 encoding

Step 6: Populate the signed properties section
----------------------------------------------

Update the document, being signed, by filling-in the following properties as per the below guidance:

| Field | Value | UBL Mapping Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DigestValue | Encoded certificate hashed property reference **CertDigest** | /Invoice /ext:UBLExtensions /ext:UBLExtension /ext:ExtensionContent /sig:UBLDocumentSignatures /sac:SignatureInformation /ds:Signature /ds:Object /xades:QualifyingProperties / xades:SignedProperties/xades:SignedSignatureProperties / xades:SigningCertificate /xades:Cert /xades:CertDigest /ds:DigestValue |
| SigningTime | Sign timestamp as current datetime in UTC | /Invoice /ext:UBLExtensions /ext:UBLExtension /ext:ExtensionContent /sig:UBLDocumentSignatures /sac:SignatureInformation /ds:Signature /ds:Object /xades:QualifyingProperties /xades:SignedProperties /xades:SignedSignatureProperties /xades:SigningTime |
| X509IssuerName | Signing certificate issuer name | /Invoice /ext:UBLExtensions /ext:UBLExtension /ext:ExtensionContent /sig:UBLDocumentSignatures /sac:SignatureInformation /ds:Signature /ds:Object /xades:QualifyingProperties / xades:SignedProperties /xades:SignedSignatureProperties / xades:SigningCertificate /xades:Cert /xades:IssuerSerial /ds:X509IssuerName |
| X509SerialNumber | Signing certificate serial number | /Invoice /ext:UBLExtensions /ext:UBLExtension /ext:ExtensionContent /sig:UBLDocumentSignatures /sac:SignatureInformation /ds:Signature /ds:Object /xades:QualifyingProperties / xades:SignedProperties /xades:SignedSignatureProperties / xades:SigningCertificate /xades:Cert /xades:IssuerSerial /ds:X509SerialNumber |

> Now the signing properties section should be ready to be hashed.

Step 7: Generate Signed Properties Hash
---------------------------------------

1. Get the properties tag only using the XPath (/Invoice/ext:UBLExtensions/ext:UBLExtension/ext:ExtensionContent/sig:UBLDocumentSignatures/sac:SignatureInformation/ds:Signature/ds:Object/xades:QualifyingProperties/xades:SignedProperties)
2. Linearize the XML block (properties tag) and remove the spaces
3. Hash the property tag using SHA-256.
4. Encode the hashed property tag using Base64 Encoder
5. The value generated would be the property named **PropsDigest**

Step 8: Populate the information in the document to create the signed document
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Populate the properties gathered into the document as per the below table to generate the signed document.

| Field | Value | UBL Mapping Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SignatureValue | Digital Signature property ref **Sig** | /Invoice /ext:UBLExtensions /ext:UBLExtension /ext:ExtensionContent /sig:UBLDocumentSignatures /sac:SignatureInformation /ds:Signature /ds:SignatureValue |
| X509Certificate | Certificate | /Invoice /ext:UBLExtensions /ext:UBLExtension /ext:ExtensionContent /sig:UBLDocumentSignatures /sac:SignatureInformation /ds:Signature /ds:KeyInfo /ds:X509Data /ds:X509Certificate |
| DigestValue | Encoded signed Properties hash property reference **PropsDigest** | /Invoice /ext:UBLExtensions /ext:UBLExtension /ext:ExtensionContent /sig:UBLDocumentSignatures /sac:SignatureInformation /ds:Signature /ds:SignedInfo /ds:Reference[@URI=’#id-xades-signed-props’] /ds:DigestValue |
| DigestValue | Encoded invoice hash property reference **DocDigest** | /Invoice /ext:UBLExtensions /ext:UBLExtension /ext:ExtensionContent /sig:UBLDocumentSignatures /sac:SignatureInformation /ds:Signature /ds:SignedInfo /ds:Reference[@Id=’id-doc-signed-data’] /ds:DigestValue |
| Signature | An electronic signature to authenticate the e-Invoice | / ubl:Invoice / cac:Signature |

> **Note**: To ensure data transfer over network, potential newline symbols or spaces added removed between XML and JSON elements are not changing the signature value, the solution leverages specialized data document canonicalization approach to ensure only significant data (names and values of fields) is used as part of the signature.

Once multiple documents are prepared as per description above they all need to be added into `documents` array when JSON is used and into `submission/documents` element when XML is used. After that the submission is ready to be sent to the `MyInvois` System by calling [Submit Document API](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/).

Additional Consideration
------------------------

The JSON document digital signature creation has been also clarified in this page : [Signature Creation JSON](/signature-creation-json/)

A sample PowerShell script for document digital signature creation can be found in this page : [Powershell Script For Signing JSON File](/files/Digital_Signature_User_Guide.pdf).

Introduction
------------

This page provides guidance on the methods and approach that can be used to create digital signature for a document. This follows UBL 2.1 published standards as document here ([Universal Business Language Version 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1.html)) for XML and here ([UBL 2.1 JSON Alternative Representation Version 2.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1-JSON/v2.0/cnd01/UBL-2.1-JSON-v2.0-cnd01.html)) for JSON.  
The methods described in this page apply only to the documents that are submitted using the APIs described in this SDK as per the description here [Submit Documents](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/)

> The submitter of the documents will have to use a valid digital certificate that is issued by a certificate authority (CA) in Malaysia as documented here [List of Certification Authorities and Recognition](https://www.mcmc.gov.my/en/sectors/digital-signature/list-of-licensees).

### Digital Signing Certificate Profile

The digital certificate used to digitally sign the submitted documents should be a valid X.509 certificate that should follow the below certificate profile.

#### Certificate Distinguished Name

Certificate distinguished name must have elements listed in the table below:

| Display Name | OID | Expected Content | Value Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Common name (CN) | 2.5.4.3 | The company or organization name. | Company Name Sdn Bhd |
| Country (C) | 2.5.4.6 | The country of the organization - 2-letter ISO code. | MY |
| Email (E) | 1.2.840.113549.1.9.1 | (Optional) an email for the organization. | noemail@org.com.my |
| Organization (O) | 2.5.4.10 | The company or organization name. | Company Name Sdn Bhd |
| Organization identifier | 2.5.4.97 | The Tax Identification Number of the organization (TIN) | C20830570210 |
| Organization Unit (OU) | 2.5.4.11 | (Optional) A value representing an organization unit in the organization. |  |
| Serial number (serialNumber) | 2.5.4.5 | The business registration number (BRN) of the organization that is linked to the TIN provided above. | 202005123456 |

#### Key Usage and Enhanced Key Usage (aka Extended Key Usage)

To ensure digital signature level, following certificate extensions must be set:

* Key Usage - “Non-Repudiation (40)”. Note that additional key usages can also be specified, but “Non-Repudiation (40)” must be present.
* Enhanced Key Usage (aka Extended Key Usage) - “Document Signing (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.12)”. Note that additional enhanced key usages (e.g., “Secure Email (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4)”) can also be specified, but “Document Signing (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.12)” must be present.

Digital Signature Creation Requirements and Considerations
----------------------------------------------------------

The list below provides the requirements for the digital signature creation along with additional considerations.

* The digital signature algorithm to be used must be **XAdES** (XML Advanced Electronic Signature). (Digital signature timestamp will still be required to be added as part of the signed properties section as listed below). This envelope allows ascertaining the validity of a signature in case the signer certificate is later revoked.
* The hashing algorithm must be SHA 256.
* The signature algorithm must be RSA.
* UBL 2.1 XML standard includes by definition the required digital signature standard that would be used as described here [UBL Digital Signature Profiles 1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/prd2-UBL-2.1/doc/dsig/cd11-UBL-DSig-1.0.html)
* The **Enveloped** digital signature profile, where the signature applies to the XML content that contains `<ds:Signature>` as an element. Implementations of enveloped signature must make sure not to include `<ds:Signature>` element and any of it’s sub-elements in the calculation of the digest and signature values as per the algorithm that will be described later.
* UBL 2.1 JSON Alternative Representation Version 2.0 doesn’t define a specification for the use of digital signatures in JSON documents for UBL, this is supported using a foreign extension which is a transliteration of the UBL extension for digital signatures.
* Although UBL 2.1 supports multiple signatures to be included in the document, the requirement is to include only a single signature element which will be described later.

Signature Creation
------------------

Signed content is entire Document structure except for the following sections:

* UBLExtension (XPath: *[local-name()=׳Invoice׳]//*[local-name()=׳UBLExtensions׳]).
* Signature (XPath: *[local-name()=׳Invoice׳]//*[local-name()=׳Signature׳]). SHA256 hashing used for creating hash of the elements to sign.

The signature creation steps would mainly target to construct the enveloped XAdES signature structure, by computing the required values for the properties referenced above.

| PROPERTY | DESCRIPTION | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Signature value | This contains the signature value that was generated by signing the document digest within the signed information section | **Sig** |
| Document digest | This is the document digest value that would be created using HEX-to-Base64 Encoder applied to the entire transformed document content. This is the value that would be signed using the private key. | **DocDigest** |
| Signed properties digest | This is the certificate digest value that would be created using HEX-to-Base64 Encoder applied to the XAdES object that is described later containing the signing certificate information and signing properties. | **PropsDigest** |
| Certificate information digest | This is the HEX-SHA256 encoded certificate information that would be part of the signing properties. | **CertDigest** |

More details on how to define structure of the document to hash, create canonical version, apply hashing, sign the hash and then embed the signature are provided in section [Signature Creation](/signature-creation/).

Signature Validation
--------------------

The validation rules for signatures are:

* Base64 encoded value that is a valid XAdES structure.
* Signing certificate is valid at the date of submission of document for validation.
* Signing certificate is issued to:
  + issuer of the document, i.e., taxpayer tax identification number and business registration number matches in certificate and document,
  + service provider (intermediary organization) who is active representative of taxpayer at the document issuance date and time and have the required permissions assigned to them to submit documents on behalf of the taxpayer. The intermediary tax identification number and business registration number matches in certificate **but** they will not match the document details.
* XAdES signature is valid RSA signature created using one of the approved certificate authorities in Malaysia (as described before).

Signature Sample
----------------

Standard Error Response
=======================

Page describes the standard error data structure and standard error codes that APIs of e-Invoice are using. If there are specialized error code and messages for a specific API, these are defined in API definition page.

Error Response Structure
========================

Error response is a single JSON object that has name value pair named `error`. This object can have the elements of type `Error` as defined in the table below.

| Property | Type | Description | Value example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| propertyName | String | The name of the target/subject of the error, e.g., the name of the parameter that caused the error. This might have the value null if the property path cannot be resolved for the target. | document |
| propertyPath | String | Optional: the path to the target/subject of the error, e.g., the path to the parameter that caused the error. This might have the value null if the property path cannot be resolved for the target. | $.InvoiceLineItem[\*].InvoicedQuantity.unitCode |
| errorCode | String | Error code that client must be able to handle. | Error03 |
| error | String | Human readable error message. If available, message is returned in English language. | Previous passwords may not be reused |
| errorMS | String | Human readable error message. If available, message is returned in Malay language. | Kata laluan lama tidak boleh digunakan semula |
| target | String | Optional: the target/subject of the error, e.g., parameter that caused the error. | password |
| innerError | innerError[] | Optional: list of multiple errors detected that caused overall API call to fail. Used to return all errors in one go so that they all can be corrected by the caller before calling again. Each Error object is of the same structure as defined in this table that allows composition of multiple errors received. | <JSON list of Error structures> |

Example error responses:

```
{
  "status": "Invalid",
  "error": {
    "propertyName": null,
    "propertyPath": null,
    "errorCode": "Error03",
    "error": "Duplicated Submission Validator",
    "errorMS： "Penduaan Sub Validatormission”,
    "innerError": [
      {
        "propertyName": "document",
        "propertyPath": "document",
        "errorCode": "DS302",
        "error": "Duplicated submitted document with UUID 132YBP1HE6GHJ0XSVNW0141J10 where the values of configured attributes match with values for the document with UUID: GJCGP9RWJF7961J8XNW0141J10”,
        "errorMs": "MS-Duplicated submitted document with UUID 132YBP1HE6GHJ0XSVNW0141J10 where the values of configured attributes match with values for the document with UUID: GJCGP9RWJF7961J8XNW0141J10”,
        "innerError": null
      ｝
    ]
  },
  "name": "Step03-Duplicated Submission Validator"
},
```

Standard HTTP Status Codes
==========================

When returning error structure standard client or server HTTP error status codes must be used.

Additional error codes are used to provide more details on top of the general HTTP Status Code. These details are returned in [error structure](#error-response-structure) that are in the body of response.

Commonly used internal error codes of the solution are defined in the table mapped to HTTP Status Code.

| HTTP Status Code | Error Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | BadRequest | Used when supplied parameters are invalid to fulfil the request. Request should not be repeated without modifying the parameters. |
| 400 | BadArgument | Returned when one of the parameters supplied is not correct. Name of the argument is provided in `target` field. |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Used then API requires token to authorize caller, but it was not provided or was malformed or the token had expired. |
| 403 | Forbidden | Used when client does not have access to the API or data requested. |
| 404 | NotFound | Used when requested object does not exist. |
| 429 | TooManyRequests | Returned by API if it called more than throttling limit allows it to be called by a single caller. `Retry-After` response header in case of this error response contains a number, indicating the seconds remaining for this client to try again. |
| 500 | InternalServerError | Server encountered error when executing client request. |
| 501 | NotImplemented | API called or the method requested is not implemented/supported. |
| 503 | ServiceUnavailable | Returned when solution is encountering internal errors that are causing it to have limited functionality. |

Correlation Information
=======================

When error is encountered, API returns correlation ID as part of `correlationId` response header value that can be used to identify the failed request when raising an issue with support team.

Getting started...
==================

This page provides more information regarding the MyInvois System

LHDNM MyInvois System
=====================

To support the growth of the digital economy, the Government intends to implement
e-Invoice in stages in an effort to enhance the efficiency of Malaysia’s tax administration management. This initiative is aligned with the Twelfth Malaysia Plan, which aims to strengthen the digital services infrastructure and modernise the tax administration system through digitalisation.

The e-Invoice will enable near real-time validation and storage of transactions, catering to Business-to-Business (B2B), Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Government (B2G) transactions.

Benefits of Adopting e-Invoice
------------------------------

The implementation of e-Invoice not only provides seamless experience to taxpayers, but also improves business efficiency and increases tax compliance.

Overall benefits of adopting e-Invoice include:

1. Unified invoicing process through the streamlining of transaction document creation, and submission of data electronically to LHDNM. The automation of data entry for transactions reduces manual efforts and human errors;
2. Facilitate tax return filing through seamless system integration for efficient and accurate tax reporting;
3. For larger businesses, the adoption of e-Invoice enables the streamlining of operations, resulting enhanced efficiency and significant time as well as cost savings through automated processes, seamless data integration, and improved invoice management; and
4. For micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), the phased implementation offers a progressive and manageable transition to e-Invoice, allowing MSMEs to align their financial reporting and processes to be digitalised with industry standards, ensuring that MSMEs to adapt over a longer period and mitigating potential disruptions.

System Overview
---------------

The following illustration showcases the primary user groups who will utilise the system, along with the external interaction components. These include:

• taxpayers who may act as the issuer and the receiver   
• tax authority employees tasked in defining and overseeing the process configurations  
• a variety of interactions available   
• authenticating the ERP system associated with an intermediary that is representing a taxpayer (acting on behalf of a specific taxpayer)

For businesses integrating their ERPs with the MyInvois System, this SDK contains two (2) main elements, namely System Integration and Notifications Management:

• System integration provides a set of APIs defined in this SDK, made accessible for taxpayers’ use   
• Notifications are sent to selected channels based on the preference of taxpayers’ representatives.

The main prerequisite element for interaction is the digital profile of the taxpayer (taxpayer identity), which must be established and set up to enable system access to the aforementioned APIs. This component is part of the taxpayer identity management module within the solution, which is also accessible to taxpayers’ representatives via web interfaces. The high-level architecture of the solution, depicting internal modules such as the identity management module, is illustrated in the figure below. Additionally, the figure displays developer resources that highlights e-Invoicing APIs, with the SDK being one of the resources.

Integration Approach
====================

This section defines multiple aspects of the integration approach that applies to all APIs defined in this SDK.
The approach to integrate ERP systems with the MyInvois System adheres to the following modern principles:

• **externalised identity** - the identities of users and systems interacting with the solution’s APIs and user interface are maintained independently from the actual document processing modules.  
• **standards based interfaces** - APIs are designed using RESTful principles, accepting and returning data in JSON format, while the supported document formats include both XML and JSON.   
• **asynchronous processing** - APIs executing more intricate operations, such as validating submitted documents. This improves the response times and reduces potential errors. To facilitate an asynchronous processing approach, the solution exposes APIs that enable result polling.   
• **data protection** - Our solution’s APIs prioritises the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data through stringent data protection measures. To safeguard all interactions with our APIs, we mandate the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, establishing secure and encrypted communication channels.
This ensures that data transmitted between clients and our servers are protected against interception and tampering by unauthorised parties. Beyond the secure transmission, we implement an additional layer of security for documents submitted to our system. Each document must be accompanied by a digital signature offering authentication, non-repudiation and integrity verification.

Feedback or queries
===================

LHDNM is committed to providing exceptional service and solutions to taxpayers while endeavouring to ensure a successful e-Invoice implementation.
