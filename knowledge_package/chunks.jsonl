It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.\n\nNote for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.\n\n### Guidance on constructing UBL -\n\nIn the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says\n\n/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID\n\nwhich means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.\n\nFor Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -\n\n```\n<Invoice>\n    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID=\"1.1\">12</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>\n</Invoice>\n```\n\nData Structure\n==============\n\nCore\n----\n\nThe data structure of the self-billed credit note v1.0 document consists of a single `document` element that contains these additional elements. Note that this description defines the data structure while actual attribute naming could be different for JSON and XML data structures.\n\n| ELEMENT | Field TYPE | DESCRIPTION | VALUE EXAMPLE | UBL Schema Mapping | Mandatory | Number of Chars | Cardinality |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Supplier | [Supplier](#supplier) | Structure representing the supplier information. |  | / ubl:Invoice / cac:AccountingSupplierParty |"}

It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.\n\nNote for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.\n\n### Guidance on constructing UBL -\n\nIn the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says\n\n/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID\n\nwhich means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.\n\nFor Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -\n\n```\n<Invoice>\n    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID=\"1.1\">11</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>\n</Invoice>\n```\n\nData Structure\n==============\n\nCore\n----\n\nThe data structure of the self-billed invoice v1.0 document consists of a single `document` element that contains these additional elements.

Note that each token issued is issued for a certain time period configured as part of MyInvois System, example can be found in [expires\\_in](#successful-response). This means that compliant ERP systems integrating with the solution should expect that some calls will return unauthorised error codes (see more on [standard error responses](/standard-error-response/)) which means that most likely the token issued has expired and needs to be renewed (by another login).\n\n**Note!** Authentication of the systems is done on identity service, not on the service hosting actual integration APIs. Use the Identity Service base address when creating the full URL to be called.\n\nSignature\n---------\n\nAs described in the [Getting started overview](/start/), solution is leveraging externalised standards based identity system to manage users, systems that are accessing solution user interfaces and APIs.\n\nTherefore solution leverages [OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) for authenticating systems and granting them access token that allows them to call other APIs described in this SDK"}

If tokens are requested for every operation, the system may impose limits on token requests. These limits will be based on each client ID and hence would be linked to the specific ERP system using the APIs.\n\n• To optimise performance, avoid making frequent login attempts. Instead, use session tokens to maintain active sessions. In the event of failed login attempts, implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to prevent overloading the system. Always ensure that credentials are securely stored, and use HTTPS for all API calls to safeguard sensitive data.\n\n• Always review the integration recommended practices at [sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices) to ensure your ERP integration is in accordance with these guidelines and follows healthy integration patterns.\n\n[Back to homepage](/)"}

For example, if the TIN is ‘SG123456789’, please input it as ‘IG123456789’.  \n• The numeric character within the TIN remains unchanged, with a maximum length of 14 characters including the prefix.\n\n**For Non-Individual TIN (with prefix C, CS, D, F, FA, PT, TA, TC, TN, TR, TP, J & LE):**\n\n• If your TIN begins with a zero ’0’ after the prefix, please remove any initial zeros after the prefix for successful validation. For example, if the TIN is ‘C01234567890’, please input it as ‘C1234567890’.  \n• If your TIN does not end with a zero ‘0’ (e.g., C123456789), please ensure you add an additional zero ’0’ at the end (e.g., C1234567890). Please note that Non-Individual TIN always ends with zero ‘0’.\n\nWhat are the environment URLs?\n------------------------------\n\n| Env | Invoicing Portal | System API | Identity Service |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| PROD | myinvois.hasil.gov.my |"}

The status is an integer value, which could be one of the following:\n\n| Status | Value | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Submitted | 1 | This means the invoice has passed initial structure validations but is still pending additional validations to be completed |\n| Valid | 2 | The status of a successful invoice validation |\n| Invalid | 3 | The status of a submitted invoice with validation issues |\n| Cancelled | 4 | The status of an invoice cancelled by the issuer |\n\nApplication Programming Interface (API)\n=======================================\n\n---\n\nHow to get sample payload?\n--------------------------\n\nYou can download the JSON and XML [Sample](/sample) payloads for various document types and scenarios from the Sample page.\n\nWhat is the Rate Limit for each API?\n------------------------------------\n\nThe rate limiting functionality implementation is using the standard HTTP rate limiting headers. Refer [here](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/integration-practices/#rate-limit) for the rate limit for each API. Hence, the caller should handle the rate limiting headers that are returned to them by the API and retry the call as per these headers. The header would specify the current number of calls that are rate limited and the time period the caller should wait before they make the next call. Please, refer back [Standard Headers Parameters](/standard-header-parameters/) to standard rate limiting headers definition.\n\nCommon observations:\n\n1. Login Too Frequent - The system token is valid for 60 minutes. Use this token for API operations rather than generating a new one for each request. Kindly"}

Note that additional key usages can also be specified, but “Non-Repudiation (40)” must be present.\n* Enhanced Key Usage (aka Extended Key Usage) - “Document Signing (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.12)”. Note that additional enhanced key usages (e.g., “Secure Email (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4)”) can also be specified, but “Document Signing (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.12)” must be present.\n\nDigital Signature Creation Requirements and Considerations\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe list below provides the requirements for the digital signature creation along with additional considerations.\n\n* The digital signature algorithm to be used must be **XAdES** (XML Advanced Electronic Signature). (Digital signature timestamp will still be required to be added as part of the signed properties section as listed below). This envelope allows ascertaining the validity of a signature in case the signer certificate is later revoked.\n* The hashing algorithm must be SHA 256.\n* The signature algorithm must be RSA.\n* UBL 2.1 XML standard includes by definition the required digital signature standard that would be used as described here [UBL Digital Signature Profiles 1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/prd2-UBL-2.1/doc/dsig/cd11-UBL-DSig-1.0.html)\n* The **Enveloped** digital signature profile, where the signature applies to the XML content that contains `<ds:Signature>` as an element."}

Note that each token is issued for a certain time period configured as part of MyInvois System, example can be found in [expires\\_in](#successful-response). This means that compliant ERP systems integrating with the solution should expect that some calls will return unauthorised error codes (see more on [standard error responses](/standard-error-response/)) which means that most likely the token issued has expired and needs to be renewed (by another login).\n\n**Note!** Authentication of the systems is done on identity service, not on the service hosting actual integration APIs.

This initiative is aligned with the Twelfth Malaysia Plan, which aims to strengthen the digital services infrastructure and modernise the tax administration system through digitalisation.\n\nThe e-Invoice will enable near real-time validation and storage of transactions, catering to Business-to-Business (B2B), Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Government (B2G) transactions.\n\nBenefits of Adopting e-Invoice\n------------------------------\n\nThe implementation of e-Invoice not only provides seamless experience to taxpayers, but also improves business efficiency and increases tax compliance.\n\nOverall benefits of adopting e-Invoice include:\n\n1. Unified invoicing process through the streamlining of transaction document creation, and submission of data electronically to LHDNM. The automation of data entry for transactions reduces manual efforts and human errors;\n2. Facilitate tax return filing through seamless system integration for efficient and accurate tax reporting;\n3. For larger businesses, the adoption of e-Invoice enables the streamlining of operations, resulting enhanced efficiency and significant time as well as cost savings through automated processes, seamless data integration, and improved invoice management; and\n4. For micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), the phased implementation offers a progressive and manageable transition to e-Invoice, allowing MSMEs to align their financial reporting and processes to be"}

These include:\n\n• taxpayers who may act as the issuer and the receiver   \n• tax authority employees tasked in defining and overseeing the process configurations  \n• a variety of interactions available   \n• authenticating the ERP system associated with an intermediary that is representing a taxpayer (acting on behalf of a specific taxpayer)\n\nFor businesses integrating their ERPs with the MyInvois System, this SDK contains two (2) main elements, namely System Integration and Notifications Management:\n\n• System integration provides a set of APIs defined in this SDK, made accessible for taxpayers’ use   \n• Notifications are sent to selected channels based on the preference of taxpayers’ representatives.\n\nThe main prerequisite element for interaction is the digital profile of the taxpayer (taxpayer identity), which must be established and set up to enable system access to the aforementioned APIs. This component is part of the taxpayer identity management module within the solution, which is also accessible to taxpayers’ representatives via web interfaces. The high-level architecture of the solution, depicting internal modules such as the identity management module, is illustrated in the figure below. Additionally, the figure displays developer resources that highlights e-Invoicing APIs, with the SDK being one of the resources.\n\nIntegration Approach\n====================\n\nThis section defines multiple aspects of the integration approach that applies to all APIs defined in this SDK.\nThe approach to integrate ERP systems with the MyInvois System adheres to the following modern principles:\n\n• **externalised identity** - the identities of users and systems interacting with the"}

This improves the response times and reduces potential errors. To facilitate an asynchronous processing approach, the solution exposes APIs that enable result polling.   \n• **data protection** - Our solution’s APIs prioritises the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data through stringent data protection measures. To safeguard all interactions with our APIs, we mandate the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, establishing secure and encrypted communication channels.\nThis ensures that data transmitted between clients and our servers are protected against interception and tampering by unauthorised parties. Beyond the secure transmission, we implement an additional layer of security for documents submitted to our system. Each document must be accompanied by a digital signature offering authentication, non-repudiation and integrity verification.\n\nFeedback or queries\n===================\n\nLHDNM is committed to providing exceptional service and solutions to taxpayers while endeavouring to ensure a successful e-Invoice implementation. We appreciate your understanding and welcome your valuable feedback. Please refer to our [contacts page](/contacts/) to share your thoughts and feedback.\n\nFor additional information on e-Invoice and system integration, please refer to the [FAQ](/faq/) section of the microsite.\n\n[Back to homepage](/)"}

It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.\n\nNote for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.\n\n### Guidance on constructing UBL -\n\nIn the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says\n\n/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID\n\nwhich means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.\n\nFor Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -\n\n```\n<Invoice>\n    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID=\"1.0\">13</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>\n</Invoice>\n```\n\nData Structure\n==============\n\nCore\n----\n\nThe data structure of the self-billed debit note v1.0 document consists of a single `document` element that contains these additional elements.

Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier.

It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.\n\nNote for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.\n\n### Guidance on constructing UBL -\n\nIn the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says\n\n/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID\n\nwhich means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.\n\nFor Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -\n\n```\n<Invoice>\n    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID=\"1.1\">13</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>\n</Invoice>\n```\n\nData Structure\n==============\n\nCore\n----\n\nThe data structure of the self-billed debit note v1.0 document consists of a single `document` element that contains these additional elements.

This version will be deprecated and replaced by version 1.1 at a later date that will be announced later.\n\n[Types](/types/)\n\nOverview\n========\n\nSelf-billed Refund Note is another document type supported by the MyInvois System. It is used to [submit issued invoices](/einvoicingapi/02-submit-documents/) with the Tax Authority.\n\nNote for Self-Billed documents - Supplier (e.g., Foreign Suppliers) could not issue the invoice on MyInvois System. Hence, Buyer issues invoice instead of the supplier. Please note that the proper supplier and buyer-related information are being included in the specific invoice.\n\n### Guidance on constructing UBL -\n\nIn the below Data Structure, if the UBL Schema mapping says\n\n/ ubl:Invoice / cbc:InvoiceTypeCode / @listVersionID\n\nwhich means that it needs to go under Invoice element as a InvoiceTypeCode element with an attribute listVersionId.\n\nFor Example - The UBL XML for InvoiceTypeCode will look like this -\n\n```\n<Invoice>\n    <cbc:InvoiceTypeCode listVersionID=\"1.0\">14</cbc:InvoiceTypeCode>\n</Invoice>\n```\n\nData Structure\n==============\n\nCore\n----\n\nThe data structure of the self-billed refund note v1.0 document consists of a single `document` element that contains these additional elements. Note that this description defines the data structure while actual attribute naming could be different for JSON and XML data structures.\n\n| ELEMENT | Field TYPE | DESCRIPTION | VALUE EXAMPLE | UBL Schema Mapping | Mandatory | Number of Chars | Cardinality |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Supplier | [Supplier](#supplier)"}

Acquiring a new authentication token with every API call to the system.\n\n   Received authentication tokens remain valid for a duration that is already specified in the response of the authentication API as per below.\n\n   By default, these token are valid for 60 minutes and hence can be used by any system APIs that requires such a token while the token is still valid.\n2. Getting the status of the submission by checking the status of each document submitted within the submission by any of the APIs “Get Recent Documents”, “Search Documents”, “Get Document” or “Get Document Details”. These APIs are designed to be used for documents retrieval after submission and validation and not during the submission operation as per the above workflows.\n3. Re-submitting the same submission over and over again without regards to the results received from the submission APIs.\n\n   The submission APIs returns results of initial processing of the submission and hence these should be used and checked before the submission is sent again.\n\n   In fact, resending the same submission should not be performed in all cases except in case of error received from the submission APIs.\n\n   Otherwise, any of the 20x response statuses should be accepted by your system and in this case the submission shouldn’t be resubmitted again as it will be automatically flagged as duplicate submission and in these cases the submission APIs might start to throttling calls being received from your ERP system.\n4. The calls to “Get Recent Documents” should be in most cases be fulfilled by the more optimized API “Search Documents”.\n\n   Calling the API “Get Recent Documents” is subject to being throttled as well.\n5.

Documents submitted are grouped into the submission. Then, each document that is part of the submission must be linked to and comply with data structure of the document type (see [document type versions supported](/types/)).\n\nDocument submission API supports documents submitted using JSON and XML format. Taxpayer ERP system or integration module is responsible for transforming the data into JSON or XML format as per the document type structure expected by API (see [document type versions supported](/types/)). Note that all documents within the submission and enclosing submission element itself needs to be in the same format. The format used should be provided through Content-type request header value.\n\nWhen API is called, it performs minimal set of validations through [validation rules](/document-validation-rules/) to check that submission is of correct structure. Then, each document that is part of the submission is checked for the taxpayer issuing the documents. The structure of each document is checked that it matches the appropriate structure of the document type version used.\n\nAfter synchronous validation succeeds, caller receives back the assigned submission ID and list of IDs of the documents that are accepted for further processing, matching them back to internal document IDs supplied so that callers can map them in taxpayer ERP system. These IDs can later be used to [retrieve"}

This entails the compression of whitespace and unnecessary characters within the documents, effectively reducing their overall size without altering their content or structure.\n\nMinification serves two primary purposes:\n\n* ⁠*Size Optimization:* By eliminating unnecessary whitespace, line breaks, and indentation, the size of XML and JSON documents can be significantly reduced. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with large datasets or documents, helping to minimize bandwidth usage and improve overall system performance.\n* *Validation Error Prevention:* Minification can help mitigate the risk of encountering validation errors, such as the 1,000 lines limitation. By reducing the overall line count of the documents, the likelihood of hitting such limits is diminished, ensuring smoother processing and transmission of data.\n\nImplementing minification as part of the document submission process not only enhances the efficiency of data transfer but also contributes to a more robust and scalable system architecture. We encourage developers to incorporate minification techniques into their workflows when utilizing the Submit Document API, thereby optimizing performance and mitigating potential validation issues.\n\n### Mapping Internal IDs to Assigned Ones\n\nTo support mapping of internal documents managed in taxpayer ERP system to documents issued or received through MyInvois System, taxpayers can supply their internal invoice"}

Therefore, solution leverages throttling techniques configured by administrators. See [standard headers description](/standard-header-parameters/) to see headers that are returned in successful responses and [standard error response information](/standard-error-response/) for throttling error information.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n**Important !**\n\n• The ERP system can submit multiple documents using batch processing. Each batch is able handle up to 100 documents, with a total size limit of 5 MB and a maximum document size of 300 KB. Submitting documents in batches rather than individually is recommended for efficiency.\n\n• The ERP system should not keep re-submit the same submission repeatedly without considering the results received from the submission API. The submission APIs return the results of the initial processing, which should be reviewed before resending a submission. The system may impose limits on the usage policy of this API, which will be based on each client ID and linked to the specific ERP system using the APIs.\n\n• The system allows for batch submissions of documents, accommodating up to 100 documents per batch, with a combined size limit of 5 MB and a maximum of 300 KB per document. Batch submissions of documents are recommended over individual submissions for increased efficiency.\n\n•"}
